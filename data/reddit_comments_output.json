I lived in Colorado Springs for awhile and desperately miss the weather, availability of healthy food choices, and the fitness community typical of Colorado. Plus, EVERY DAY was a good hair day thanks to low humidity.  I liked that the entire state was generally environmentally conscious.  Now that I live in a city that pioneered the industrial revolution, I can definitely say that we are not very green.  My town doesn't even offer recycling of basic materials like glass or plastic.\n\nI very much admire crunchy hippies like OP.  I've been trying to make positive changes in my household; this manifests as using baking soda and vinegar to scrub my sinks instead of harsh solvents, not eating take out, limiting processed foods and cooking nearly everything at home, and trying to be mindful of what I put on my skin.  I've also been gluten and sugar free for 17 years, and I drink alcohol maybe once a year.  I can't even tell you how those dietary restrictions revolutionize your skin and hair, you'd never believe me!\n\nLike the OP mentioned, I second and HIGHLY recommend making the move to Dr. Bronner's soaps and lotions.  No, I'm not a sponsor, and I used to be one of those gals totally thrilled by all the new scents at Bath n Body Works or boutique shops.  I totally don't apologize for it because it's a fun little treat to go there and sniff everything available.  However, I started thinking about what was actually \\*in\\* it, and a friend at yoga recommended switching to Dr. Bronner's.  I recommend the almond and citrus scents, as well as the peppermint body lotion."

I come from a working class background and it was not a topic that was ever brought up - you just had this paycheck and next week's paycheck.

            "The comments are bringing out two very strange camps for that net worth - people salty and calling her a trust fund kid and people telling her how responsible and financially savvy she is. \n\nNeither of those things are really true IMO. She has clearly received a trust of some sort as it is mathematically impossible for her to have saved 144k as it's more than her entire salary combined for all of her working years. It is not responsible or savvy to receive a trust. It's just a blessing/luck. She probably did not earn a single dime of that money. That's okay. It's still hers. She still has a job since $144k isn't going to have you set for life.\n\nI just don't like people counting inheritances and trust to financial responsibility. Is someone making 41k with student loans and no trust less financially responsible because they were not born into a family that could give them that? Of course not. OP seems nice and normal and certainly responsible in many ways but receiving a large sum of money that she did not earn in any way has nothing to do with that.\n\nShe gave the best and most thorough explanation she possibly could. If she said nothing and people found out she left out her trust, they'd be furious she left out financial information. She includes it and some people are still salty. There's no winning. I am very happy with her explanation because it shows how we are all starting from different points and if someone has more money than you, it's not just because they worked harder. They and you both have circumstances outside of your control. That is okay and neither of you has anything to feel guilty about.\n\nMy dad gave me a bunch of money yesterday for no real reason. I am not financially responsible because it is still in my account. I'm just lucky that my dad felt like doing that.\n\n\nOk rant over. She seemed nice. No further comments.",

Certainly worse ways to spend money than on housing and education though.\n\nThe comments section though - I don't think it's that rude to be shocked that she has over a quarter million dollars left over, so the original fund was probably over half a million! That's a lot! No one said screw you OP, they were just like, thats a lot of money, and you're hella privileged. They're not wrong. I don't get the people who are outraged over comments mentioning that.

            "Thank you so much for all of this!! I'm so excited to read all the messy diaries I missed 😂",
            "Wow!!  Thanks for putting the work in.  I can’t wait to dig into these next week and relive some old ones and discover some new ones.",
            "OP you are the hero I needed this weekend!!",
            "Thank you for doing this!!! Can’t wait to spend my weekend enjoying the mess and wholesomeness",
            "OMG thank you. I only started reading MDs in September 2019 so I haven't read many prior to 2019. Bless you for putting this together",
            "This is amazing, thank you for putting it together! And you included my diary as an ‘Interesting’ one, I’m honored 😊",
            "Bless you for putting in all this work!  Now to read....",
            "you are my hero. [how I felt reading all of the Messy diaries](https://media.giphy.com/media/fCUCbWXe9JONVsJSUd/giphy.gif)",
            "Thank you so much for doing this! I’m going through serious money diary detox and I love this’",
            "Some of the messy ones I thought \"oh, this wasn't that bad\" then got to the comment section LOL. Like ah yes, I see the mess now.",
            "Ok can we please discuss the month in NYC on a $70,000 salary? Filed under “interesting” but totally should have been “messy” everything about it is just so ?!?!?!?!!!! Boyfriend pays for everything despite her making a decent salary, but she constantly mentions how she insists on paying the most meager contributions to prove she is “independent” even though she totally is not? EXTREMELY performative girl boss instagram account-y discussions of wage gap/other women in the workplace issues (and then if you read the comments apparently one of those wage gap stories she mentioned was literally plagiarized from Ellevest and not even her real story?!), even just her discussion of her trips... I am just astounded and confused and need this MD to be seen thanks!!!!",
