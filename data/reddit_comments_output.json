Neither are active forms, and both need to be converted to the active form in the body. Folic acid is actually more bioavailable than food folate, so it absorbs better. I‚Äôd still take the vitamin to make sure you‚Äôre getting enough!"

Certainly worse ways to spend money than on housing and education though.\n\nThe comments section though - I don't think it's that rude to be shocked that she has over a quarter million dollars left over, so the original fund was probably over half a million! That's a lot! No one said screw you OP, they were just like, thats a lot of money, and you're hella privileged. They're not wrong. I don't get the people who are outraged over comments mentioning that.

Is it normal to consider your kids‚Äô 529s part of your net worth?\n\nKind of a bummer that it sounds like she‚Äôs not continuing to pay her ‚ÄúGREAT‚Äù cleaning person. I get that the cleaning person isn‚Äôt doing work for her right now, but $50/week wouldn‚Äôt break this household.",
            "here in the U.K. someone broke quarantine after returning from northern Italy to go eat at a restaurant, they sat near an elderly man who then contracted COVID from said quarantine breaker and passed away. I think of that story whenever I see people like this, all you‚Äôre telling me is that you‚Äôre selfish, irresponsible and think you‚Äôre above everyone else.\nI know she didn‚Äôt eat out, but even if she stayed 6ft away from anyone else whilst shopping and skiing, she was still spreading germs and risking other people infected. these rules have been implemented for a reason, I don‚Äôt know why people think they know more than medical officers or scientists.",
            "Honestly she was terrible even without the COVID 19 stuff, but it's totally in character for how she acted. Like just...ugh. Fruhstuck? Bragging about her travel? Humble bragging about all her kid's activities? Talking about sewing, yet no mention of sewing some masks? \n\n\nShe has COVID-19! This is not a maybe. She needs to stop acting like it's some little inconvenience. It's a global pandemic and she has most certainly made someone very ill from her actions this week.\n\n\nThe NY wellness diarist was bad, but she really only did two (BIG) objectionable things to me, going out to a bar and restaurant one day and flying. I hate that she flew but as someone else who lives alone, mental health is still important. I wish she had stayed with a symptom-free friend in NY and rode it out together. I think it's stupid that her family is driving to SC for no reason, but if they don't stop much, are all asymptomatic, and don't come within six feet of anyone not in the family, they are essentially posing no risk. It's still needless though. Aside from the bar/restaurant, I don't think she really went out of her way, and also, there's no sign she has COVID-19. Again I don't love that she flew to Atlanta but being completely alone and isolated for months on end is a health risk in and of itself.\n\n\nThis woman has COVID-19, and now thanks to her, so do a lot more people in the Rockies. She had grocery delivery available. She could have ran around the block. She went out of her way to expose her disease to everyone. Like, she made an actual effort to do so! If grocery delivery was not an option, she still shouldn't have gone to the store (have a friend go and leave it on your porch), but she had every resource to appropriately quarantine and made very deliberate choices not to.",

It's so narrow sighted and selfish and is doing nothing but harm. If  people can stay at home for a solid 12 weeks , she can manage a fortnight of no contact. \n\nI'm actually upset.

I guess that coronavirus isn‚Äôt that big of a deal to the wealthy lol",
            "I have a question for you all. There are no wrong answers, just something me and my husband have been going back and forth on:\n\nHow come some (seemingly healthy) folks are OK getting Instacart delivered to them by a stranger (sickness status unknown and you don‚Äôt know who they‚Äôre living with or interacting with or if they‚Äôre even social distancing) who also has to interact with the public at the store but not want to go to the stores themselves?\n\nIsn‚Äôt it safer for you to go to the store yourself where you can control your own precautions and you‚Äôve been socially isolating so you know the chance of you passing it on is pretty slim? \n\nFor me, personally, I feel more comfortable with what I can control and my gloves mask and sanitizer than asking one more person to interact with my groceries.\n\nWhat are you all doing about grocery shopping?",
            "I can usually find something to like about a diarist, but nope. She should absolutely not be out of the house at all. \n\nShe said she‚Äôs either asymptomatic or immune - no one is immune! She‚Äôs a carrier. \n\nAlso the husband going for a walk? Clearly he‚Äôs not taking it seriously either.",
            "So this poster went to the grocery store and skiing after learning she had close exposure to COVID? And then justifies it later by saying she is either asymptomatic or immune (which isn‚Äôt possible by the way, no one is immune to this). \n\n....",

Some people will never be financially stable and that doesn't make them or their children any less deserving of being alive. They are basically suggesting we wipe out entire economic classes.
