Everything is sanitized before it comes in the house.\n\nThen, we find out we have a MAJOR electrical issue in our walls yesterday.  One that requires the breakers to more than half of our house be turned off due to fire risk.  An electrician HAS to come because things like electricity (when you work from home) are essential.  I am freaked the hell out that an unknown entity has to enter my house...so it doesn't burn down.  I have hives ya'll.
