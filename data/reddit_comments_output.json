Neither are active forms, and both need to be converted to the active form in the body. Folic acid is actually more bioavailable than food folate, so it absorbs better. I’d still take the vitamin to make sure you’re getting enough!"

If her parents paid fully for undergrad and law and gave her a down payment, I get the point, they're rich. Certainly worse ways to spend money than on housing and education though.\n\nThe comments section though - I don't think it's that rude to be shocked that she has over a quarter million dollars left over, so the original fund was probably over half a million! That's a lot! No one said screw you OP, they were just like, thats a lot of money, and you're hella privileged. They're not wrong. I don't get the people who are outraged over comments mentioning that. Why the hell is slick avocado so worked up, nothing even bad was said about OP.\n\nEDIT ok I went back and read it and OP acknowledges more or less that she's been given every advantage, I doubt she'd disagree with the comments.",

She could have easily passed it to a grocery employee,  fellow shopper, or someone she passed on her multiple trail outings. What she was doing is the behavior you can observe if you haven't had contact with COVID-19. If it's in your house, you do not leave your house unless it's on fire. It terrifies me to think that someone may die because OP wanted to pick up some alcohol and go for a run. And I'm mad because I know R29 posted this solely for the reaction it would get.",

Is it normal to consider your kids’ 529s part of your net worth?\n\nKind of a bummer that it sounds like she’s not continuing to pay her “GREAT” cleaning person. I get that the cleaning person isn’t doing work for her right now, but $50/week wouldn’t break this household.",
            "here in the U.K. someone broke quarantine after returning from northern Italy to go eat at a restaurant, they sat near an elderly man who then contracted COVID from said quarantine breaker and passed away. I think of that story whenever I see people like this, all you’re telling me is that you’re selfish, irresponsible and think you’re above everyone else.\nI know she didn’t eat out, but even if she stayed 6ft away from anyone else whilst shopping and skiing, she was still spreading germs and risking other people infected. these rules have been implemented for a reason, I don’t know why people think they know more than medical officers or scientists.",
            "Honestly she was terrible even without the COVID 19 stuff, but it's totally in character for how she acted. Like just...ugh. Fruhstuck? Bragging about her travel? Humble bragging about all her kid's activities? Talking about sewing, yet no mention of sewing some masks? \n\n\nShe has COVID-19! This is not a maybe. She needs to stop acting like it's some little inconvenience. It's a global pandemic and she has most certainly made someone very ill from her actions this week.\n\n\nThe NY wellness diarist was bad, but she really only did two (BIG) objectionable things to me, going out to a bar and restaurant one day and flying. I hate that she flew but as someone else who lives alone, mental health is still important. I wish she had stayed with a symptom-free friend in NY and rode it out together. I think it's stupid that her family is driving to SC for no reason, but if they don't stop much, are all asymptomatic, and don't come within six feet of anyone not in the family, they are essentially posing no risk. It's still needless though. Aside from the bar/restaurant, I don't think she really went out of her way, and also, there's no sign she has COVID-19. Again I don't love that she flew to Atlanta but being completely alone and isolated for months on end is a health risk in and of itself.\n\n\nThis woman has COVID-19, and now thanks to her, so do a lot more people in the Rockies. She had grocery delivery available. She could have ran around the block. She went out of her way to expose her disease to everyone. Like, she made an actual effort to do so! If grocery delivery was not an option, she still shouldn't have gone to the store (have a friend go and leave it on your porch), but she had every resource to appropriately quarantine and made very deliberate choices not to.",

She lists her husband's retirement account and her children's 529s but makes a point to mention that her and her husband have separate finances. Okay, great. But where is your money in your name?\n\nAlso...she doesn't pay for their mortgage? Maybe the husband owned the house before they got together but like...what does she contribute? I'm so confused.",

            "I mean...in the UK it's been in force for a while that if ANYONE in your home is symptomatic you bar the doors and stay in for 14 days. Longer if you start showing symptoms. And if you are vulnerable, like me, you get the full 12 week lockdown wagon. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI find it utterly frustrating and tenuous that being 'immune or asymptomatic and I'm okay with that' is a thing. It's so narrow sighted and selfish and is doing nothing but harm. If  people can stay at home for a solid 12 weeks , she can manage a fortnight of no contact. \n\nI'm actually upset.

I guess that coronavirus isn’t that big of a deal to the wealthy lol",
            "I have a question for you all. There are no wrong answers, just something me and my husband have been going back and forth on:\n\nHow come some (seemingly healthy) folks are OK getting Instacart delivered to them by a stranger (sickness status unknown and you don’t know who they’re living with or interacting with or if they’re even social distancing) who also has to interact with the public at the store but not want to go to the stores themselves?\n\nIsn’t it safer for you to go to the store yourself where you can control your own precautions and you’ve been socially isolating so you know the chance of you passing it on is pretty slim? \n\nFor me, personally, I feel more comfortable with what I can control and my gloves mask and sanitizer than asking one more person to interact with my groceries.\n\nWhat are you all doing about grocery shopping?",
            "I can usually find something to like about a diarist, but nope. She should absolutely not be out of the house at all. \n\nShe said she’s either asymptomatic or immune - no one is immune! She’s a carrier. \n\nAlso the husband going for a walk? Clearly he’s not taking it seriously either.",
            "So this poster went to the grocery store and skiing after learning she had close exposure to COVID? And then justifies it later by saying she is either asymptomatic or immune (which isn’t possible by the way, no one is immune to this). \n\n....",

            "Yeah the hypocrisy in the comments is too much for me on this one. I don't know why people feel like they have a right to comment on her reproductive choices? It's her body and her life and she can choose to have 6 kids if she wants to! Also, the comments about people only having kids when they are financially stable is so out of line. Some people will never be financially stable and that doesn't make them or their children any less deserving of being alive. They are basically suggesting we wipe out entire economic classes. It's classist and it's racist.",

Their kids seem well-cared for and they’ve figured out a routine clearly. I don’t understand why everyone gets so up in arms about parents being able to/not being able to pay for their kids college. Like anything else, if you can afford it, great, if not, plenty of people have figure out how to get an education without financial help from their parents. \n\nOn another note, I thought I drank a lot of coffee but WOW do these two drink a lot of coffee.",
            "SIX freaking kids and she's three years older than me, hell no do not want. That sounds so un-fun and exhausting. Not gonna say anything in the comments section because I am glad someone who's not a 24 year old in NYC making 200k and spending it on Soulcycle submitted. It's at least interesting to hear about other lives. But when I hear six kids, let alone at 34, I think maybe that person is like a Mormon or whatever the Duggar family religion is.\n\nEDIT - Ok R29 commenters are really going in on her. I think six kids is crazy but she's not a bad mother because she can't pay full tuition costs for six kids.",
            "It was a good read- not a lot of MDs with kids, so seeing 6 was a shocker. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut also insane, I grew up in a household that sounds a lot like OPs (except my mom was the au pair and didn't work lol) and the money insecurity was REAL. If OP or her hubs lose their job they're in so, so much trouble.",
            "I feel like the diaries that have women blowing coke and binge drinking get more support and solidarity than a mom with 6 kids.  This is like the wild west up in here.  And I say that as someone with 1 sibling and no kids herself.\n\nWomen are always kvetching about unfairness.  I especially love when it's justified, like the glass ceiling, patriarchal reinforcements, blatant sexism, and all that jazz we love to shake our fists at.  Cool, shake your fist then propagate change.  Preach on, sister.\n\nI think the saddest part of the entire MD community is the sharpshooting pure judgment from all sides of the fence.  No one is every happy!  The biggest hurdle holding back women?  Other women.  We validate this insidious idea that we are never \\*enough.\\*  It starts with us!",
