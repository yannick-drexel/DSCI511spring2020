I lived in Colorado Springs for awhile and desperately miss the weather, availability of healthy food choices, and the fitness community typical of Colorado. Plus, EVERY DAY was a good hair day thanks to low humidity.  I liked that the entire state was generally environmentally conscious.  Now that I live in a city that pioneered the industrial revolution, I can definitely say that we are not very green.  My town doesn't even offer recycling of basic materials like glass or plastic.\n\nI very much admire crunchy hippies like OP.  I've been trying to make positive changes in my household; this manifests as using baking soda and vinegar to scrub my sinks instead of harsh solvents, not eating take out, limiting processed foods and cooking nearly everything at home, and trying to be mindful of what I put on my skin.  I've also been gluten and sugar free for 17 years, and I drink alcohol maybe once a year.  I can't even tell you how those dietary restrictions revolutionize your skin and hair, you'd never believe me!\n\nLike the OP mentioned, I second and HIGHLY recommend making the move to Dr. Bronner's soaps and lotions.  No, I'm not a sponsor, and I used to be one of those gals totally thrilled by all the new scents at Bath n Body Works or boutique shops.  I totally don't apologize for it because it's a fun little treat to go there and sniff everything available.  However, I started thinking about what was actually \\*in\\* it, and a friend at yoga recommended switching to Dr. Bronner's.  I recommend the almond and citrus scents, as well as the peppermint body lotion.",
