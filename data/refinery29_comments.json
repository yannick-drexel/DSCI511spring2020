I think everyone's got a hardship right now - homeowners have mortgage issues, renters have rent issues, hell even frontline workers have issues working the frontline!  OP - maybe you can ask your landlord to spread the month's payment over the rest of your lease? Easier to handle vs a balloon payment to be sure. The landlord will <em eventually</em  get their money, and it'll be less hardship on you.",

Disclaimer, I am from Central Europe so a lot of the American discourse on taxes and especially the ‚Äúyou only deserve what you pay‚Äù mentality  sounds outright crazy to me. 1. Tax equality is not only about taxing earnings proportionally. If you have fixed taxes, such as value added taxes for food and stuff, high earners have a proportionally lower tax burden. Same if you don‚Äôt tax certain things that are more common with wealthy people, such as earnings from interest. I am sure that proportionally to your income, you don‚Äôt pay a lesser percentage in taxes. 2. The right to receive medical care should never ever be tied to contributions. Which is why a state cannot be run like a company. Please don‚Äôt ever feel shame for receiving medical care. It is a states responsibility for its citizens to provide it and the real shame in my opinion is that so many countries are failing in that aspect.",

The OP isn't expecting any of this to be paid, her family just wants to do it for her. My SO and I make a combined salary of $500k plus and my parents would sooner pick a fight then ever let us pay for dinner. But on the back end I would never ask my parents to pay me back for anything, we work as one family unit. I find it weird when parents or vice versa children keep count of who owes what.

The allowable amount is usually calculated by reference to the Medicare rates for services (multiplied by some amount, e.g., 120%, 130%).  That's a long way of saying to prepare for the fact that insurance might not cover 70% of your $185 therapy sessions.  It might be closer to 70% of $120 - depends on how your sessions are coded.",

People of color get prison sentences all the time for less than what you did. You distributed a drug that you had a prescription for to someone who didn't, which the law considers to be a felony (as opposed to possession, which is a much lighter crime in the eyes of the law). Moreover, you might think \"Ativan is a harmless suburban/white collar drug that's totally different from something like cocaine,\" but you would be completely wrong. Ativan is a benzodiazepine. In medical school we call these benzos for short. In our substance abuse course in med school, we spent around 10x the amount of time on benzos as on cocaine. Why? Because benzos not only cause overdose deaths (especially when mixed with alcohol), but also cause *withdrawal deaths*. Cocaine doesn't cause withdrawal, but benzodiazepines do, and that can be fatal. Using benzodiazepines in the absence of a medical diagnosis is incredibly irresponsible.",

Since I know there will be questions, figured I'd get those answers in early. +10 to Gryffindor! 1) But how much does your husband make, and why dont you post it? Nobody ever counts their husband's salary, and they're THE WORST.<ul <li My husband doesnt have a salary. He worked a very soul sucking job in the govt to help save up for what we originally thought was going to be a much shorter trip (which has now become a lifestyle) that he couldnt do on the road. His job allowed me time to find clients that I love working with and don't feel shitty working for, and we currently have no intention of him trying to find a job. He takes care of repairs, cooking, streaming, and is an all around supportive badass.</li </ul 2) How do you not know your net worth?<ul <li You do?? That's such an adult thing. Part of it is, with all the renovations, I have no idea what our RV is worth. They're not like houses - they only depreciate. I dont pay nearly enough attention to my 401k and investments. Should I? Sure. Will I? Probably not until something freaks me out and I panic about it, tbh.</li </ul 3) How are your flowers doing in Animal Crossing?<ul <li Wonderful, thoughtful question. They're well, thank you. </li </ul 4) Did Carole Baskin kill her husband?<ul <li Totally.</li </ul This is a crazy time we are in.

It not a good idea to quit your job and take off. There are bunches of people out there that have done that without thinking ahead about there life when they're old. The older you get the more medical situations show up. Most people below 40 don't realize this. We been RVing for 12 years now. and we are retired so our trips are 3 to 5 months at a time. So we're pretty much fulltiming it when we're on the road. We don't have to worry about this covid 19 because we didn't sell our house. We paid it off before we started RVing.   We waited till we were debt free to do it. We worked hard to be able to do pretty much anything we want to do and we don't have to worry about money. Were 71 now and have years to RV left. If you can work from home then fulltime RVing is possible. Otherwise don't quit your day job to try this.  Most people doing this are not going to tell you anything negative because it won't make them look like they made the right decisions.   Save up the money and pay off the house and cars and credit cards. And research RVs for at least a year before buying one. All RVs break down whether they're new or not. It can be a good thing to buy used because someone else has paid for the problems they have.

I say this as a person who has privilege both by birth and by marriage.  I have worked somewhat hard for the things I have, but I have also achieved financial stability and comfort because I have ALWAYS had some sort of safety net, and opportunities available to me because of my privileged status.  Just my two cents and again I don't mean to pick on you OP, I just hope to change the conversation around privilege!",

I reacted to 90% of all FODMAP categories lol so I now follow a low-FODMAP diet, with a few exceptions of food I know I can handle. I did that process with the help of a dietitian and it made such a difference, so I highly recommend seeing if that is an option! Another thing I recommend is downloading the MONASH university app as it tells you what foods you can eat, which ones are high in FODMAPS, and the serving size you can eat, and can filter it to your sensitivities. Good luck, it will be worth it in the long run!",

I am confident that dairy and artificial sweeteners are not a trigger for me based on past experiments (I know they‚Äôre not ‚Äògood‚Äô for you, but we all need a little vice. As a treat.). I started the FODMAP experiment to identify veggies that are hurting my gut as I usually stick to mostly meats/veggies and I am highly allergic to a lot of fruits which are too high in sugar for me anyways (no more peaches or apples ever!).  As an update- since the time I‚Äôve written this, I have gotten much more on track and will be permanently cutting out cashews, peas, broccoli, and soy (and limiting my artificial sweeteners for good measure- I‚Äôm so sad).  I‚Äôve also been continuing to track my spending and it‚Äôs crazy how much a specialized diet controls your spending options- I wish I could get by on just a head of cauliflower for dinner and that quality protein was cheaper.

A couple of things that helped me: my OBGYN recommended I start taking a supplement called Oncovite, which I started taking before the procedure... when they biopsied the tissue they removed from me, my doc told me that the abnormal cells were gone, and I‚Äôve had clear paps ever since. I absolutely know everyone has a different experience and no two bodies are the same, but I wanted to share some of my experience and offer a bit of hope. Secondly, I strongly believe that my aggressive efforts to drastically minimize the stress in my life played a huge role in keeping me healthy. I was also working as a designer, and also had dreams of becoming a freelance photographer full-time. I think my job was putting invisible stress on me, and ironically when I did quit that job and start freelancing (which is what I do now, full time) it took away the stress...I think because I am earning more, even though it isn‚Äôt a ‚Äústeady‚Äù paycheck.

One thing that I don't see mentioned in this thread and that finally clicked for me was that even if you are taking all of the vitamins in this world, reducing your stress etc. if you're still sleeping with the same guy and not using condoms, chances are that you will continue to be reinfected with the HPV.  My gyno had advised me that I should be using condoms with my boyfriend, at least until I'd cleared the virus, I ignored her advice at that time. It wasn't until I broke up with the boyfriend I was with during my abnormal paps that I noticed that all my paps since about 6 months post breakup have been clear. Honestly everything else about my lifestyle and health has stayed the same.  This might be obvious, but I wanted to share what I've learned from my own experience (and lack of listening to professionals in the first place!) in case it makes a difference to someone going through the stress of abnormal paps :)",

I'm 25, and have been getting abnormal pap smears for the last several years because I have high-risk HPV. I have strains 16 and 18, the two strains that have the highest possibility to make my cervical cells become cancerous. I'm surprised that you had a colposcopy done at 23‚Äîthat's pretty young, and most gynos don't recommend those until you're at least 25 because your immune system is stronger when you're younger. I got my first colposcopy done this year, and it was the scariest thing I've ever had to do. My results from my colposcopy (to make a very long, boring story short) stated that even though I have abnormal cells on my cervix, they're pretty much dormant, so I just need to get a pap smear done every year. As scary and terrifying abnormal paper smears are,I want you to know that it honestly is totally normal. You're doing the right thing in getting it checked out and monitored though. The more you stay on top of it, the higher your recovery is IF they find something in the future. I do want to also reassure you just because you have abnormal cells on your cervix, that doesn't mean that you're GOING to get cervical cancer. It just means those cells COULD. COULD doesn't mean WILL. As long as you're taking good care of yourself, eating right, exercising, doing things to boost your immune system, and going to regular doctor's appointments, I PROMISE you you will be okay. :-) You've got this!",

I use this to cover my monthly chiropractor visits (Back pain, am I right?) and the leftover I plan to invest. My company offers investment plans at the end of each fiscal year to invest \"left over\" money from your HSA and I plan to take full advantage of that. My retirement is currently 3% of my income for now. I plan to up that come fall. As apart of my hire, I started at $50k a year and in 6 months (September) receive a $5k raise, so that will put my annual salary at $55,000 a year. They will reevaluate my income and put in for another raise once I graduate. I started at my company in June of 2019 as an intern, caught on very quickly, and got the opportunity to come on full time!   You all have been so amazing and supportive in the comments section!

There's a lot of sacrifice (have you looked at the amount of school you have to take??) as well as hard work to get into a solid position in either field. Also, remember that DC is ridiculously expensive. I'm a government employee and the last time I went I was blown away that prices at restaurants were all at least double to what I'm used to in Indianapolis.

They‚Äôre coming into the hospital because they‚Äôre already sick with something. People with pre-existing conditions, such as patients already in the hospital, are among those that die from COVID-19. If he didn‚Äôt want to take the necessary precautions to protect his patients, he should have quit his job.

Your actions are disrespectful to my cousins who were unable to attend their own mother‚Äôs burial, to the rest of my family and to all those families who cannot attend the funerals of their loved ones, and to those people living alone through all of this. Your actions are disrespectful to our health care workers, many of whom have sent their own children away so as not to endanger them,all of whom are risking their lives to save others. Your actions are disrespectful to my cousins and countless other doctors, nurses, and hospital employees across the country who are being given ONE N95 mask per FIVE day period; to grocery and other essential workers who keep us fed, to our delivery drivers; and to our military, still fighting the good fight.

I wanted to share my opinion on your husband's reactions in case he's been having things like this happen a lot lately. I was in his same position just over a year ago due to something called Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria - basically random hives and allergic reactions to no specific trigger. My body and immune system were on overdrive largely due to stress and anxiety (I was dealing with unemployment at the time), and I also had a couple of trips to the ER after a few severe reactions. I found that cutting out dairy, soy and gluten made a huge difference in the severity and frequency of my hives, along with taking daily antihistamines.   It's a horrible feeling to have these unknown reactions, but eventually after working with my allergist and naturopath I was able to cut out the antihistamines and replace them with natural supplements, but it's different for every person I've talked to about this condition. I'd recommend looking up support groups on Facebook, and wish you both the best of luck!",

Plus, since we've had to postpone our wedding, it made it really easy to email everyone with updates and we don't have to pay for new printed invitations/rsvp cards.   There is also a reddit forum called Weddings Under 10k that has great ideas on how to cut costs, and may even be able to suggest affordable vendors in your area. Good luck planning!",

I really admire your calm, practical approach to helping him get what he needs. As someone who has really benefitted from therapy and psychiatry for anxiety (including benzodiazepines!) I wish I had had someone like you to encourage me to get medical help, and not just offer the typical advice, i.e. \"Try to think happy thoughts\" and \"Exercise more!\" Having someone who treats your needs really seriously is such a gift. Thinking of you and your new family in this difficult time. xo",

I have gone to the ER for it multiple times, I ended up in ENT physical therapy. My physical therapist realized it was psychological and had me do a swallow test where I swallowed food with dye in it so I could see it on an x-ray in a lab and SEE that I had no obstruction and that helped a lot. But basically unless I am on a high dose of antidepressants I get to a point where I feel like I am choking or obstructed all the time.  His panic and then ER visit was very VERY familiar to me.

Also OP - hope you're well during the current situation (as a fellow NYC-er, getting groceries is even crazier whether it's through an online delivery service or waiting in person in lengthy lines outside stores) and keeping her mental health as a priority.",

Sadly my family is not rich or financially well so I did have to take out student loans but that doesn't make think anything bad about someone who's parents paid for their schooling or anything else. I think we need to stop judging people and let them live. So what if OPs parents have helped her, they are her parents and I'm sure they want what is best for their kids. I am all pro family support.

I do think that OP realizes overall how great her privilege is at not having any debt and owning her apartment. It might be forgotten in moments where she expects her friends in Big Law to cover more of the tab (while forgetting that although they may have huge salaries, many of them probably also have huge huge debt and less overall privileges than she does.)But alas, we're all human and we all have our moments.

Social Distancing is for the majority of the populace that don't have COVID, have no known exposure, etc. This is to keep healthy people healthy, and flatten the curve. Quarantining is for people with COVID, people with known exposure to COVID, people travelling from infection hot spots, etc. This is to cut off the virus from spreading outside those already infected/exposed. OP should have been quarantining, full stop. Social Distancing is not enough for someone who has daily close contact with people that are infected; those people need to essentially be sealed off from the rest of the population for 14 days (although I'm not 100% clear on if it's 14 days from diagnosis, 14 days from the onset of symptoms, or 14 days since the symptoms have stopped?) OP <em wanted</em  to go skiing, so she did, multiple times over the course of this week. OP <em wanted</em  tequila and other items from the store without waiting for delivery, so she went.  I <em want</em  to see my sister, who is not even 6 months into her career as an RN, something she busted her ass to achieve, but I know that it's best for us to not physically see each other right now. I <em want</em  to celebrate my birthday next week with a family meal, but I'll be happy for a Facetime with those that I don't already live with. I think people are frustrated because OP chose to expose herself to others essentially bc she <em wanted</em  to get out of the house, not out of actual need.",

I agree, stressful times, you should be allowed to work out, but not only is it super dangerous for everyone in your community for you to be out right now, you leave your poor sick husband to take care of sick twins when he is also sick. I know people who traveled recently and had zero symptoms and had to go live in someones guest house for 2 weeks. This is very irresponsible of you. I know people with family members who have died from COVID 19 and they weren't allowed to have a funeral! Only the funeral director and priest were allowed. You even mention that your husband has had shortness of breath- sorry if it were me I'd actually be scared to leave them all alone so I could go skiing, which is also not just dropping in at an hour long yoga class, it generally takes time to get to and from the ski areas and it's not a quick activity, it can take hours.

You could spread it to other people and, potentially, kill them. That means no going to the grocery store or a trail run or skiing!  Please, please check the CDC and WHO websites for advice.  There is also evidence, by the way, that the dosage of virus you receive matters - so snuggling with your kids and sleeping in the same bed with your partner while they are sick is also very ill advised. Some studies (again, not definitive) show that partners of people who are first infected outside of the home do worse, likely because they get a higher dose of virus by being in the same home. Your husband, if he is well enough, should be doing child care and you should isolate from them.  (This is, by the way, also why many young doctors and nurses are dying - they think - high virus loads that they are exposed to on the job.) I am glad, by the way, that so far your family seems to be doing well, but please follow public health advice and #stayathome.",

And I actually think there's a lot to like / admire here, from her clear love of family, appreciation for the finer things in life and efforts to stay in touch with family and friends digitally while providing a normal environment for her kids.  She's making a very reasonable effort to self-isolate while caring for her family: going outside to exercise alone and occasional trips to the grocery store seem totally reasonable to me. It wasn't mentioned, but I hope she used reasonable precautions like a mask and/or gloves. In fact, living in a similar area of the country, it has been impossible to get groceries delivered. Lots of parts of the country just aren't set up for that.  I know it's a very scary time, but I think a lot of the hate going on in the comments is misdirected frustration about everything else going wrong in the world.",

So by the time this was written and published, she was well aware about the state of her backyard, as well as the world.  Sadly, in Denver, you see plenty of the same mentality.

All of my family is doing great, everyone is healthy and we are ALL following the guidelines. I have stayed home since I came back, close to a month ago and miss my family dearly but I agree with you all! I think we should def stay inside to flatten the curve. I wanted this MD to showcase mi cultura, mi familia and ofc me. TYSM for your kind words and I hope you and your family stay safe during this time!!!!",

It was mainly caused by physical pelvic floor issues, but further exacerbated by pain whenever I tried penetrative sex. My first five years of being sexually active were really bad and I felt a lot of guilt, which seeped into every aspect of my life. I eventually bought a set of soft silicone dilators (google them) and used guided self-hypnotism therapy (you can download it) to eventually be able to insert up to the largest size. I was still scared of actual sex so went to a physical therapist who specialized in this. After just two sessions, I was able to have penetrative sex. Mind you, the whole process took a year and a half. My point being, there's lots of help for these issues - I was on an online group for a while which really helped. Don't beat yourself up over this; it is indeed something you can plan for and control. </li <li Face masks: I have been using DIY face masks my whole life. My go to recipe is chickpea flour, turmeric, yogurt. Sometimes I add a squeeze of lemon juice but do this only if your skin is very oily.  </li </ul ",

For those with time at home, now is a great time for a little bit of introspection.  I definitely think those who get it have also had experience with mindfulness and have done the work of becoming more familiar with who they are as people. I recently started a free online yale course, the science of well-being, and one of the assignments is to complete an assessment on your strengths. It seems that some of yours are definitely appreciation of beauty and excellence, gratitude, and perspective. I think its seriously amazing how you frame all these little, seemingly simple things as worthy of appreciation and joy!",

I started going to pelvic floor physical therapy and started using dilators and was cured within 1.5 months of weekly appointment + daily dilating. Now, I don't need to dilate and have successful and pleasant penetrative sex.   It's frustrating that women's sexual pain is not believed. After diagnosis, I went from unbearable burning pain when trying to insert a finger to fully cured in less than 4 months. There is a cure - it may not be as straightforward as my story but it's treatable. Good luck!",

You shouldn't be paying for anything out of pocket, if you need toys, food, etc. the humane society should be giving those to you. Second, 10-12 weeks is the hardest time and be prepared for damage to your apartment. This is essential where your kittens are in their toddler phase. They will be rambunctious so rambunctious. Finally if you have a cat that hisses when you come near, and is scared try putting a little wet food on your fingers. It will lead to a positive association.

I had to talk to a friend of mine who is going out every other day (and her husband goes to work everyday etc...) because she says if you're using essential businesses it's okay to go out whenever. It's not. Make a list and stock up. Make coffee at home. You can order at Target on the app on your phone and just pick up as well, which is helpful. Way more people are high risk than many people realize (not you specifically, I think generally people don't realize it) Just having asthma puts you at high risk but someone I loved who was not old or high risk died yesterday so what does it even mean to not be high risk at this point?

Your roommate is moving back and forth between your place and her BFs. Does her BF ever see anyone else? Does he have a roommate? Does Y ever see anyone else? Does he have a roommate? The whole point of social distancing is that it only takes one asymptomatic person to spread. If we all pick 1-2 people who we think it‚Äôs safe to go outside and see, then this is already pointless.
