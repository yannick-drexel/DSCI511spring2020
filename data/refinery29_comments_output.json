Not many of you caught my comment about commiserating with my friends over first world problems (because I know that’s all we have). Many people have it much worse. However, this was a snap-shot of what my life is like, and I’m not going to apologize for not having the same struggles as others. I do my best to raise my child with awareness of her innate privilege and the responsibilities it brings to do our best to recognize and empathize with the lives of others. All I can do is continue to listen and defend when I witness acts of injustice. Thirdly, to the ‘drug deal’ itself: I one hundred percent realize that it is illegal and potentially unsafe. I also used to share alcohol (when I was underage!) with my friends, and I never have gotten my weed tested at a lab to make sure it wasn’t mixed with anything. Heaven forbid, I’ve also taken mushrooms, and some tabs of acid, too! And I shared them! (Cont. below)",

People of color get prison sentences all the time for less than what you did. You distributed a drug that you had a prescription for to someone who didn't, which the law considers to be a felony (as opposed to possession, which is a much lighter crime in the eyes of the law). Moreover, you might think \"Ativan is a harmless suburban/white collar drug that's totally different from something like cocaine,\" but you would be completely wrong. Ativan is a benzodiazepine. In medical school we call these benzos for short. In our substance abuse course in med school, we spent around 10x the amount of time on benzos as on cocaine. Why? Because benzos not only cause overdose deaths (especially when mixed with alcohol), but also cause *withdrawal deaths*. Cocaine doesn't cause withdrawal, but benzodiazepines do, and that can be fatal. Using benzodiazepines in the absence of a medical diagnosis is incredibly irresponsible.",

Since I know there will be questions, figured I'd get those answers in early. +10 to Gryffindor! 1) But how much does your husband make, and why dont you post it? Nobody ever counts their husband's salary, and they're THE WORST.<ul <li My husband doesnt have a salary. He worked a very soul sucking job in the govt to help save up for what we originally thought was going to be a much shorter trip (which has now become a lifestyle) that he couldnt do on the road. His job allowed me time to find clients that I love working with and don't feel shitty working for, and we currently have no intention of him trying to find a job. He takes care of repairs, cooking, streaming, and is an all around supportive badass.</li </ul 2) How do you not know your net worth?<ul <li You do?? That's such an adult thing. Part of it is, with all the renovations, I have no idea what our RV is worth. They're not like houses - they only depreciate. I dont pay nearly enough attention to my 401k and investments. Should I? Sure. Will I? Probably not until something freaks me out and I panic about it, tbh.</li </ul 3) How are your flowers doing in Animal Crossing?<ul <li Wonderful, thoughtful question. They're well, thank you. </li </ul 4) Did Carole Baskin kill her husband?<ul <li Totally.</li </ul This is a crazy time we are in.

It not a good idea to quit your job and take off. There are bunches of people out there that have done that without thinking ahead about there life when they're old. The older you get the more medical situations show up. Most people below 40 don't realize this. We been RVing for 12 years now. and we are retired so our trips are 3 to 5 months at a time. So we're pretty much fulltiming it when we're on the road. We don't have to worry about this covid 19 because we didn't sell our house. We paid it off before we started RVing.   We waited till we were debt free to do it. We worked hard to be able to do pretty much anything we want to do and we don't have to worry about money. Were 71 now and have years to RV left. If you can work from home then fulltime RVing is possible. Otherwise don't quit your day job to try this.  Most people doing this are not going to tell you anything negative because it won't make them look like they made the right decisions.   Save up the money and pay off the house and cars and credit cards. And research RVs for at least a year before buying one. All RVs break down whether they're new or not. It can be a good thing to buy used because someone else has paid for the problems they have.

Literally gave up my car and had an expired license for months until I had to drive back home for a visit. My husband moved here because he makes double the income here for the same job and he literally saves lives and busts his ass every single day. There's also a severe lack of specialists who do exactly what he does and his team is struggling to find someone to move here and join them (a few people on his team have actually moved away) so he works 20+ hours at a time and can't take time off right now. Despite all that, it still took us years to be able to buy a house, so we're all struggling.  You were a lot nicer about your statement about people moving to Portland, but just thought I'd give you some perspective from someone who moved here and sometimes feels really shitty hearing these comments. :)",

Her commute is challenging, but as are many people's commutes, whether stuck in cars for long periods of time, hoping to fend off road rage incidents or crammed into commuter trains and buses praying not to contact COVID 19.

This implies (whether it’s implicit bias or not) that Chinese food is not usually or cannot, in and of itself, be upscale. It’s the same logic where people are okay paying $500 for a French meal but scoff at some Chinese dishes being “too expensive.” Considering all the anti- Chinese sentiment (racism, xenophobia) right now I think it’s a) a weird choice to publish this diary while ignoring this gaff and b) not address the implicit bias.",

My only advice to the diarist is to try and do more batch cooking &amp; increase her protein/fat intake to better nourish herself &amp; to try and budget some money for retirement planning. It may seem far off, but it's important &amp; every penny counts in the long run. Best of luck to her, thanks for the read!",

I can't tell you how many clinicians (e.g., people who theoretically know what to look for) from nurses to respiratory therapists to attending physicians to department heads and everyone in between who kept coming to work despite having \"a tickle in their throat\" (sometimes for WEEKS even) that later led to a positive COVID-19 test. If not a positive patient, then a coworker. If not this week, then next. I would really urge to think of it not as a possibility, but as an inevitability and the question is only when.  It's the worst, because obviously there's no option to not come to work if you're serving in such an essential role. But it means you, OP, can't just be careful, you have to be militant about precautions and distancing.

They’re coming into the hospital because they’re already sick with something. People with pre-existing conditions, such as patients already in the hospital, are among those that die from COVID-19. If he didn’t want to take the necessary precautions to protect his patients, he should have quit his job.

Those $280 tickets I scouted are now over $900 which makes me think I missed my window to get back to Chengdu.  This outbreak is going nuts in the US right now (deja vu?) and today is the day my siblings drove into town and we are remembering my mom. One sister and husband decided they will stay here for a week or as long as they need to (working from home). The other and her husband are heading back because his work isn't cancelled (.. yet! We have a bet).  I couldn't just take more students or rearrange my schedule because people who have been in lockdown in China and not working are not dishing out $$$ for online tutoring. Thankful for my normal paycheck+the editing+barebones of tutoring.  The wedding might be off? We still don't know.  Due to my mom's illness last year, we have a weirdly large amount of leftover medical supplies including masks and rubbing alcohol and rubber gloves, so I'm feeling prepped.  My dad and whole family are very healthy, so we are just going to sit and wait. Thanks for encouragement, guys. I was so anxious about getting murdered in the comments!!!",

Now as things have escalated here, I’m not sure what’s going to happen, or when. I can relate to the decision of whether or not to buy a plane ticket back to China, the struggle to find the motivation to do my job in a new way, and the overall uncertainty permeating daily life. But I am thankful I’m able to remain here for the time being safe with my family. All the best to you, OP!",

Everything has started shutting down in Toronto, and I worry so much about my parents. I loved how you cooked so much at home for both you and him.

I also loved reading her thoughts on money and her relationship with money throughout the diary.  Who hasn't felt like a baller after payday and gone a little crazy the weekend after payday?  Who doesn't use coupons or the library when they're trying to save money, but still enjoy wine-filled HHs for balance?    One thing I didn't see in the diary was any long-term savings, like a 401k or Roth.  I know you're tackling your student loan debt, but start saving for your future to take advantage of that sweet compound interest.  Like going to the gym, it's a good habit and if you pay yourself first and put money away where you can't touch it, you learn to live on a leaner budget.  I love all your volunteer work with the doggies!!!!  One thought--if you want to tackle that CC debt faster, consider a side hustle working for Rover or some other kind of dog sitting.    In closing, you're awesome OP and I'd love to see where you are in a year with your CC debt and savings goals!",

OP, you are so awesome and as someone who's adopted three cats and volunteered at animal shelters, thank you for your time and hard work!   P.S. I totally identify with the struggle of a shopping problem - I specifically am vulnerable to shoes and handbags. I had a hard reality check last year. I realized that I had a habit of not only hiding all of my purchases from my husband but also lying about how much things cost (we keep separate financial accounts for fun spending / non-shared spending so it was lying about how I use my own money, but I was still so ashamed and worried he would judge me). What finally did the trick for me was diving really deep into living a more minimalist life and seeing that all of the material things I had made me feel anxious and claustrophobic. This is may be on the more extreme side of curbing a shopping problem, but maybe one worth exploring!   P.P.S. I love your point about supporting girlfriends on their accomplishments rather than only engagements, weddings, and babies. I'd love for more women to be valued in more complex ways!",

It's not easy to acknowledge areas that need some work and it sounds like you're doing a great job getting on top of it- awesome!  Just a tip that's worked for me: Try setting up your paycheck so that at least a small amount is deposited into a different account, or even multiple accounts. It's such an easy way to save money without trying, AND it psychologically makes you feel like you have less play money to spend in your checking account. Also it seems like the student loans/CC debt doesn't have to be an either/or thing...for example you could divert $250 of each paycheck into a separate account just to start chipping away at that. Best of luck, you're doing great!",

My one thing, and I see a few others mentioned it too is that you should really focus on the credit card debit before the student loans.  I get one is accruing interest, and the other isn't, but that's not the only factor.  If something happens (God forbid), and you can't pay off the CC before the 0% falls off, that'll be a big hit...also paying off the CC will help your credit score more than paying of the student loan.  Just think about it.",

Some stuff:  1) I invest 15% towards retirement (pre-tax) 2) I receive $2,400 a year from a family member for my student loans which I just received, so I now have 3K left. I have a CC debt snowball for the credit cards and have done a pretty good job of strategically timing out my payments so that by I'm CC debt free by Oct 2021, well before my 0% APR hits. I'm choosing to pay my student loans off first because I have a huge fear that I won't be able to get my shit together regarding my spending and I'm just afraid that I'll get myself out of CC debt and then slide right back in. At least my student loans will be GONE in 4 months. I recognize how tenuous it seems and honestly I have a lot of shame around this, but I'm doing really good in regards to working on this.  3) I did stop home for 30 minutes to hang with my dog between work &amp; the shelter! She also has my roommate &amp; her bf at home for some socialization. But I do feel bad for these long days.  4) My insurance is under my mom, which probably helps with the lower cost.",

Although your plan probably states 70% covered, it usually means 70% of the <strong allowable amount</strong  is covered.  The allowable amount is usually calculated by reference to the Medicare rates for services (multiplied by some amount, e.g., 120%, 130%).  That's a long way of saying to prepare for the fact that insurance might not cover 70% of your $185 therapy sessions.  It might be closer to 70% of $120 - depends on how your sessions are coded.",

He was powerless to physically do much of anything around the house, and he couldn't drive...and mentally, he would often get down about the lack of mobility and the isolation at home.

I would remind myself that this was a temporary situation. We've been married for over 10 years and to me, this is just part of the drill - but starting off married life knowing that the person you chose will likely never be able to help carry the weight, to hold a job etc. is another thing entirely - especially if OP wants children down the road.",

For those who are implying or stating that he is a lazy, freeloading man-baby really need to check their ableist assumptions at the door.  Can it be challenging to be in a relationship with someone with a severe mental illness?  Can there be significant caregiving responsibilities involved?  Yes and yes.  For folks with these illnesses, sometimes just making it through the day is an huge challenge.  The illnesses themselves are serious, and the drugs to treat them also come with a host of significant side effects.  Fatigue, mental confusion, slowed processing, and flat affect all can result from the illness or from the drugs.  Those of you who are implying that he should just buck up, make an effort, and get a job should really spend some time educating yourselves.  NAMI is a great place to start.  Some people with  mental/emotional disabilities can certainly work but some truly cannot.  We don't know the history of their relationship, why she has chosen to be with him, or what agreements they have around caregiving.

I'm of course still the main earner though.  It can be really challenging to be in a relationship like this! I was 21 when he and I started dating, and once finances got real around my mid-twenties, it was stressful to realize that being in a relationship with him meant being the primary earner, maybe forever.   What helped us a lot was really re-framing things so that we are always sharing responsibilities. Yes, I may be the one who pays for the majority of our rent, but it's both of our responsibilities to make sure that we can, together, afford our living costs. If my income goes down, together we need to figure out how we're going to make ends meet. He knows our income and expenses, and finds ways to cut things where possible. He does things like manages all of our subscription services for us (though I think this is partly because I'm not great at unsubscribing when not using something. Looking at you, STARZ!). There are plenty of ways to step-up that don't involve being the breadwinner, and him doing these things has been really good for both of us.   He's truly a partner to me, even without working, between chores, moral support as I get through a master's program, and more. Now, we're engaged, and I look forward to doing eventually our taxes together, look into different options for saving and investing, etc.",

I wanted to share some info - please obviously check with your doctor about this bc I could be wrong - but I have a friend who works at hospital and she shared with me that the reason more young people are dying of COVID in US (as opposed to China where death toll was relatively low for ppl below 65) is because vaping is a big issue here. The way the virus affects our lungs, vaping actually puts you at a higher risk for fatal outcome than smoking cigarettes. Smoking is obviously terrible for you and could result in cancer in the long term, but in the short term, they are seeing that smoking is better than vaping specifically as a relates to COVID. Might be worth exploring this! sending love &lt;3",

If an RBT is going to be used, it should be via synchronous telehealth with the BCBA at the distant site providing real time feedback and analysis, which would still require you to go into the patient's home. So... this doesn't make sense to me.  Nonetheless, ABA therapists are highly susceptible to job burn out and often the victims of employers taking advantage of labor law loop holes.

But it also seems like the super together \"optimized\" exterior you have going, coupled with the defensive (and honestly kinda unhinged) replies to comments, is obscuring some deeper issues that could be helped tremendously with therapy, assuming you don't go already. I don't think you would feel the need for validation and to defend your life/choices/diary so intensely (while also insulting a good chunk of the site's readership, in some cases) if you were secure and at peace with yourself.   I say this as someone who has struggled with a bunch of mental health issues and severe perfectionism that I've had to work through for years.

Based on the Daylight Savings, her trip to SF was from Friday, March 6 to Monday, March 9.  Most Americans by March 5th (the day before her trip) were very much aware of Coronavirus, but many did not quite understand how severe or contagious it is.  Most young adults were dismissive of it or at least not particularly concerned with protecting themselves.  Combined with Trump Administration's ineffective messaging on COVID-19 (essentially \"not a big deal, don't panic, just wash your hands\"), one can see why OP decided to continue living her life as normal.  I live near SF.  I was supposed to get married in early May of this year.  In the first week of March, I thought things would \"blow over\" by the end of April and my wedding would go on, albeit with a smaller guest list.  By March 16, I was no longer confident and was forced to cancel my wedding.  THAT'S HOW FAST THINGS CHANGED.",

Disclaimer, I am from Central Europe so a lot of the American discourse on taxes and especially the “you only deserve what you pay” mentality  sounds outright crazy to me. 1. Tax equality is not only about taxing earnings proportionally. If you have fixed taxes, such as value added taxes for food and stuff, high earners have a proportionally lower tax burden. Same if you don’t tax certain things that are more common with wealthy people, such as earnings from interest. I am sure that proportionally to your income, you don’t pay a lesser percentage in taxes. 2. The right to receive medical care should never ever be tied to contributions. Which is why a state cannot be run like a company. Please don’t ever feel shame for receiving medical care. It is a states responsibility for its citizens to provide it and the real shame in my opinion is that so many countries are failing in that aspect.",

I remember going to a park on a beautiful spring day and just sitting alone and crying behind my sunglasses while watching all of these people have friendships.

Also, I'm an avid proponent for marijuana and personally use for insomnia too , but marijuana is a downer aka a depressant. Its not good to partake when you're depressed. Lastly, LA is a hard city to make friends in but I think you should make more effort to do so through intramural sports, meetups for people that are into what you're into, maybe hang with some friends of your friend who moved from LA to SF, maybe a happy hour with a co-worker who is somewhat cool...

Some things I've found that help: going for walks, either in my neighborhood or in parks; finding the right balance/amount of weed and wine to help me relax without just making me depressed; participating in virtual yoga and dance classes; reconnecting with friends I don't talk to much via phone or FaceTime; talking to my mom every otherish day; trying to eat right (I got on the scale yesterday and...oof); and (most importantly) limiting my intake of news and social media. I went down a rabbit hole Friday and ended up calling my parents in hysterical tears Friday night, convinced that I was going to be stuck in my house for two years. This time sucks and is scary, but we'll get through it. Sending you all the love!",

Long distance is TOUGH, but I also want to point out that cultural differences can be huge, especially in communication (read: fighting!). This is something that took a LONG TIME for my boyfriend and I to work through, and it was really hard, but we got on the same page eventually. Adding to this, I was pretty young, wasn't sure what I wanted to do in life, and I was nervous about leaving all my friends and family and American life behind! But something kept telling me to keep going with him, even when it got tough.   5 years later, we still live in Europe, we are getting married later this year, and although I'm not really one to spout ~soulmates~, I can tell you that he is simply the best lifemate I could have chosen.

My unsolicited advice is that making some type of routine would really help, especially if you start the day off with a quick workout.   On food, I get that we are living in an apocalyptic time with grocery stores being crowded and disease-ridden, but if the store is a 30 minute walk, go walk there twice a week. Keep your distance from others, lysol wipe the cart down and wash your hands before and after the trip. But as long as it's not raining, I dont see what the downside of a 30 minute walk to the store is. Plus, it would double as exercise. You clearly have a lot of free time, so time is not an excuse!",

It's exactly what I fear here in the US among my peers—too eager to go back out and socialize in groups, only to be exposed the virus and forced into isolation yet again.   After all the optimism of returning to normalcy, the last two days of this MD showed that this thing isn't really over. I'm sad for the restaurants who are asked to close and lose business, but evidently the caution (and surveillance) is still needed.   PS, I am also curious where the OP's home country is.

It was super stressful and I have totally been in your shoes. A couple of things that helped me: my OBGYN recommended I start taking a supplement called Oncovite, which I started taking before the procedure... when they biopsied the tissue they removed from me, my doc told me that the abnormal cells were gone, and I’ve had clear paps ever since. I absolutely know everyone has a different experience and no two bodies are the same, but I wanted to share some of my experience and offer a bit of hope. Secondly, I strongly believe that my aggressive efforts to drastically minimize the stress in my life played a huge role in keeping me healthy. I was also working as a designer, and also had dreams of becoming a freelance photographer full-time. I think my job was putting invisible stress on me, and ironically when I did quit that job and start freelancing (which is what I do now, full time) it took away the stress...I think because I am earning more, even though it isn’t a “steady” paycheck.  It is incredible what stress can do to the body, and we have to take care of our whole selves.",

I just want to say, there’s no such thing as an “immune boosting diet”. Any diet that claims to boost your immune system is pseudoscience. There are of course plenty of other reasons to eat vitamin-filled fruits and veggies, as well as lean protein sources, so there’s no harm in that.   I totally understand wanting to try something that claims to boost your immune system or claims to be “anti-cancer.”  Illness and cancer are scary, and it would be nice to think we could cure them with magic diets. It just doesn’t work that way (though certain cancers.. eg colon cancer.. are linked to certain less healthy diets).   I hope you got the answers you wanted from your colposcopy. Also don’t be afraid to switch doctors to find one who talks to you more. Listening to your patients is arguably one of the most important things for a doctor to do.",

Also had a colonoscopy and was given all of the general advice about the body naturally clearing HPV. I'm now 30 and the last few paps I've had have been clear!  One thing that I don't see mentioned in this thread and that finally clicked for me was that even if you are taking all of the vitamins in this world, reducing your stress etc. if you're still sleeping with the same guy and not using condoms, chances are that you will continue to be reinfected with the HPV.  My gyno had advised me that I should be using condoms with my boyfriend, at least until I'd cleared the virus, I ignored her advice at that time. It wasn't until I broke up with the boyfriend I was with during my abnormal paps that I noticed that all my paps since about 6 months post breakup have been clear. Honestly everything else about my lifestyle and health has stayed the same.  This might be obvious, but I wanted to share what I've learned from my own experience (and lack of listening to professionals in the first place!) in case it makes a difference to someone going through the stress of abnormal paps :)",

I'm 25, and have been getting abnormal pap smears for the last several years because I have high-risk HPV. I have strains 16 and 18, the two strains that have the highest possibility to make my cervical cells become cancerous. I'm surprised that you had a colposcopy done at 23—that's pretty young, and most gynos don't recommend those until you're at least 25 because your immune system is stronger when you're younger. I got my first colposcopy done this year, and it was the scariest thing I've ever had to do. My results from my colposcopy (to make a very long, boring story short) stated that even though I have abnormal cells on my cervix, they're pretty much dormant, so I just need to get a pap smear done every year. As scary and terrifying abnormal paper smears are,I want you to know that it honestly is totally normal. You're doing the right thing in getting it checked out and monitored though. The more you stay on top of it, the higher your recovery is IF they find something in the future. I do want to also reassure you just because you have abnormal cells on your cervix, that doesn't mean that you're GOING to get cervical cancer. It just means those cells COULD. COULD doesn't mean WILL. As long as you're taking good care of yourself, eating right, exercising, doing things to boost your immune system, and going to regular doctor's appointments, I PROMISE you you will be okay. :-) You've got this!",

I wanted to share my opinion on your husband's reactions in case he's been having things like this happen a lot lately. I was in his same position just over a year ago due to something called Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria - basically random hives and allergic reactions to no specific trigger. My body and immune system were on overdrive largely due to stress and anxiety (I was dealing with unemployment at the time), and I also had a couple of trips to the ER after a few severe reactions. I found that cutting out dairy, soy and gluten made a huge difference in the severity and frequency of my hives, along with taking daily antihistamines.   It's a horrible feeling to have these unknown reactions, but eventually after working with my allergist and naturopath I was able to cut out the antihistamines and replace them with natural supplements, but it's different for every person I've talked to about this condition. I'd recommend looking up support groups on Facebook, and wish you both the best of luck!",

I wish I had had someone like you to encourage me to get medical help, and not just offer the typical advice, i.e. \"Try to think happy thoughts\" and \"Exercise more!\" Having someone who treats your needs really seriously is such a gift.

I have gone to the ER for it multiple times, I ended up in ENT physical therapy. My physical therapist realized it was psychological and had me do a swallow test where I swallowed food with dye in it so I could see it on an x-ray in a lab and SEE that I had no obstruction and that helped a lot. But basically unless I am on a high dose of antidepressants I get to a point where I feel like I am choking or obstructed all the time.  His panic and then ER visit was very VERY familiar to me.

I have done multiple elimination diets over the last decade, from weeks to months at a time, and I usually eat a low carb, almost zero sugar, high fat/protein diet. I am confident that dairy and artificial sweeteners are not a trigger for me based on past experiments (I know they’re not ‘good’ for you, but we all need a little vice. As a treat.). I started the FODMAP experiment to identify veggies that are hurting my gut as I usually stick to mostly meats/veggies and I am highly allergic to a lot of fruits which are too high in sugar for me anyways (no more peaches or apples ever!).  As an update- since the time I’ve written this, I have gotten much more on track and will be permanently cutting out cashews, peas, broccoli, and soy (and limiting my artificial sweeteners for good measure- I’m so sad).  I’ve also been continuing to track my spending and it’s crazy how much a specialized diet controls your spending options- I wish I could get by on just a head of cauliflower for dinner and that quality protein was cheaper.   Thanks to everyone who had helpful advice and the other folks who shared their gut issues, I love you all!",

I use this to cover my monthly chiropractor visits (Back pain, am I right?) and the leftover I plan to invest. My company offers investment plans at the end of each fiscal year to invest \"left over\" money from your HSA and I plan to take full advantage of that. My retirement is currently 3% of my income for now. I plan to up that come fall. As apart of my hire, I started at $50k a year and in 6 months (September) receive a $5k raise, so that will put my annual salary at $55,000 a year. They will reevaluate my income and put in for another raise once I graduate. I started at my company in June of 2019 as an intern, caught on very quickly, and got the opportunity to come on full time!   You all have been so amazing and supportive in the comments section!

I know it's taboo, but OP, is this a fair reading? Have you and your fiancee found a supportive community? Arizona can be pretty conservative.

I say this as a person who has privilege both by birth and by marriage.  I have worked somewhat hard for the things I have, but I have also achieved financial stability and comfort because I have ALWAYS had some sort of safety net, and opportunities available to me because of my privileged status.

I am still unlearning a lot from a family of origin that labeled a lot of things as good or bad. I promise I am only referring to things like harsh oven cleaner, drain cleaner, and the excessive amounts of drugs and alcohol I was consuming prior to sobriety. All of it is a personal choice and I'm far from perfect. You do you! Obviously!  Also sorry about the foot bath. I guess I didn't realize how weird that was!  Xoxo- SoupPot",

Because of (naturally) strict rules around foster care, foster parents in many states can’t just leave the children with a grandparent or friend, or even hire a teenage babysitter, like biological parents can.   It’s still a big commitment: there are classes, etc., but it isn’t the same commitment as becoming a full-out foster parent. And if you’re considering becoming a foster parent in the future, it might be a good first step.",
