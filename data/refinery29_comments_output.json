It was super stressful and I have totally been in your shoes. A couple of things that helped me: my OBGYN recommended I start taking a supplement called Oncovite, which I started taking before the procedure... when they biopsied the tissue they removed from me, my doc told me that the abnormal cells were gone, and I‚Äôve had clear paps ever since. I absolutely know everyone has a different experience and no two bodies are the same, but I wanted to share some of my experience and offer a bit of hope. Secondly, I strongly believe that my aggressive efforts to drastically minimize the stress in my life played a huge role in keeping me healthy. I was also working as a designer, and also had dreams of becoming a freelance photographer full-time. I think my job was putting invisible stress on me, and ironically when I did quit that job and start freelancing (which is what I do now, full time) it took away the stress...I think because I am earning more, even though it isn‚Äôt a ‚Äústeady‚Äù paycheck.  It is incredible what stress can do to the body, and we have to take care of our whole selves.",

I just want to say, there‚Äôs no such thing as an ‚Äúimmune boosting diet‚Äù. Any diet that claims to boost your immune system is pseudoscience. There are of course plenty of other reasons to eat vitamin-filled fruits and veggies, as well as lean protein sources, so there‚Äôs no harm in that.   I totally understand wanting to try something that claims to boost your immune system or claims to be ‚Äúanti-cancer.‚Äù  Illness and cancer are scary, and it would be nice to think we could cure them with magic diets. It just doesn‚Äôt work that way (though certain cancers.. eg colon cancer.. are linked to certain less healthy diets).   I hope you got the answers you wanted from your colposcopy. Also don‚Äôt be afraid to switch doctors to find one who talks to you more. Listening to your patients is arguably one of the most important things for a doctor to do.",

Also had a colonoscopy and was given all of the general advice about the body naturally clearing HPV. I'm now 30 and the last few paps I've had have been clear!  One thing that I don't see mentioned in this thread and that finally clicked for me was that even if you are taking all of the vitamins in this world, reducing your stress etc. if you're still sleeping with the same guy and not using condoms, chances are that you will continue to be reinfected with the HPV.  My gyno had advised me that I should be using condoms with my boyfriend, at least until I'd cleared the virus, I ignored her advice at that time. It wasn't until I broke up with the boyfriend I was with during my abnormal paps that I noticed that all my paps since about 6 months post breakup have been clear. Honestly everything else about my lifestyle and health has stayed the same.  This might be obvious, but I wanted to share what I've learned from my own experience (and lack of listening to professionals in the first place!) in case it makes a difference to someone going through the stress of abnormal paps :)",

I'm 25, and have been getting abnormal pap smears for the last several years because I have high-risk HPV. I have strains 16 and 18, the two strains that have the highest possibility to make my cervical cells become cancerous. I'm surprised that you had a colposcopy done at 23‚Äîthat's pretty young, and most gynos don't recommend those until you're at least 25 because your immune system is stronger when you're younger. I got my first colposcopy done this year, and it was the scariest thing I've ever had to do. My results from my colposcopy (to make a very long, boring story short) stated that even though I have abnormal cells on my cervix, they're pretty much dormant, so I just need to get a pap smear done every year. As scary and terrifying abnormal paper smears are,I want you to know that it honestly is totally normal. You're doing the right thing in getting it checked out and monitored though. The more you stay on top of it, the higher your recovery is IF they find something in the future. I do want to also reassure you just because you have abnormal cells on your cervix, that doesn't mean that you're GOING to get cervical cancer. It just means those cells COULD. COULD doesn't mean WILL. As long as you're taking good care of yourself, eating right, exercising, doing things to boost your immune system, and going to regular doctor's appointments, I PROMISE you you will be okay. :-) You've got this!",

I use this to cover my monthly chiropractor visits (Back pain, am I right?) and the leftover I plan to invest. My company offers investment plans at the end of each fiscal year to invest \"left over\" money from your HSA and I plan to take full advantage of that. My retirement is currently 3% of my income for now. I plan to up that come fall. As apart of my hire, I started at $50k a year and in 6 months (September) receive a $5k raise, so that will put my annual salary at $55,000 a year. They will reevaluate my income and put in for another raise once I graduate. I started at my company in June of 2019 as an intern, caught on very quickly, and got the opportunity to come on full time!   You all have been so amazing and supportive in the comments section!

I think we need to stop judging people and let them live. So what if OPs parents have helped her, they are her parents and I'm sure they want what is best for their kids. I am all pro family support. Haters need to stop hating. Be happy for everyone.",

I do think that OP realizes overall how great her privilege is at not having any debt and owning her apartment. It might be forgotten in moments where she expects her friends in Big Law to cover more of the tab (while forgetting that although they may have huge salaries, many of them probably also have huge huge debt and less overall privileges than she does.)But alas, we're all human and we all have our moments.

I think everyone's got a hardship right now - homeowners have mortgage issues, renters have rent issues, hell even frontline workers have issues working the frontline!  OP - maybe you can ask your landlord to spread the month's payment over the rest of your lease? Easier to handle vs a balloon payment to be sure. The landlord will <em eventually</em  get their money, and it'll be less hardship on you.",

You came in to this with an enormous target on your back because your household brings in over $600k a year and nothing gets the commenters more riled up than that.

Although your plan probably states 70% covered, it usually means 70% of the <strong allowable amount</strong  is covered.  The allowable amount is usually calculated by reference to the Medicare rates for services (multiplied by some amount, e.g., 120%, 130%).  That's a long way of saying to prepare for the fact that insurance might not cover 70% of your $185 therapy sessions.  It might be closer to 70% of $120 - depends on how your sessions are coded.",

OP should have been quarantining, full stop. Social Distancing is not enough for someone who has daily close contact with people that are infected; those people need to essentially be sealed off from the rest of the population for 14 days (although I'm not 100% clear on if it's 14 days from diagnosis, 14 days from the onset of symptoms, or 14 days since the symptoms have stopped?)

You have a sick husband and kids, probably with COVID 19 or at the very least a regular flu and you are leaving the house for ANYTHING at all?? Especially when you live in an area where you can surely get grocery delivery and just stay inside for your workouts. I agree, stressful times, you should be allowed to work out, but not only is it super dangerous for everyone in your community for you to be out right now, you leave your poor sick husband to take care of sick twins when he is also sick. I know people who traveled recently and had zero symptoms and had to go live in someones guest house for 2 weeks. This is very irresponsible of you. I know people with family members who have died from COVID 19 and they weren't allowed to have a funeral! Only the funeral director and priest were allowed. You even mention that your husband has had shortness of breath- sorry if it were me I'd actually be scared to leave them all alone so I could go skiing, which is also not just dropping in at an hour long yoga class, it generally takes time to get to and from the ski areas and it's not a quick activity, it can take hours.

However, I do want to say that if you are 39 years old and have nothing saved for retirement, that is not good!!    If your employer offers a 401k match you should at LEAST contribute up to the match.  If they don't offer a match, it's still a good idea to contribute as much as you possibly can to a 401k or IRA.  Pay yourself first and THEN spend on extras like nice wine, lacrosse for your five-year-olds, and international travel.  It seems like you are trying to live a higher-class lifestyle than your income actually affords, at the expense of financial stability and retirement savings.",

Some studies (again, not definitive) show that partners of people who are first infected outside of the home do worse, likely because they get a higher dose of virus by being in the same home. Your husband, if he is well enough, should be doing child care and you should isolate from them.

She's making a very reasonable effort to self-isolate while caring for her family: going outside to exercise alone and occasional trips to the grocery store seem totally reasonable to me. It wasn't mentioned, but I hope she used reasonable precautions like a mask and/or gloves. In fact, living in a similar area of the country, it has been impossible to get groceries delivered. Lots of parts of the country just aren't set up for that.

My husband moved here because he makes double the income here for the same job and he literally saves lives and busts his ass every single day. There's also a severe lack of specialists who do exactly what he does and his team is struggling to find someone to move here and join them (a few people on his team have actually moved away) so he works 20+ hours at a time and can't take time off right now. Despite all that, it still took us years to be able to buy a house, so we're all struggling.  You were a lot nicer about your statement about people moving to Portland, but just thought I'd give you some perspective from someone who moved here and sometimes feels really shitty hearing these comments. :)",

But her job allows her to work from home and leave most days at 5:00. She has leisure time for reading books and friends. At age 31, her salary is much higher than the average 50 year old's salary. Her commute is challenging, but as are many people's commutes, whether stuck in cars for long periods of time, hoping to fend off road rage incidents or crammed into commuter trains and buses praying not to contact COVID 19. Most commenters seem to agree that OP's life is stressful. What am I missing? Maybe I'm just envious; but I would love to have her problems, in comparison to the ones I or those around me have.",

My heart sank when I read the last day. It's exactly what I fear here in the US among my peers‚Äîtoo eager to go back out and socialize in groups, only to be exposed the virus and forced into isolation yet again.   After all the optimism of returning to normalcy, the last two days of this MD showed that this thing isn't really over. I'm sad for the restaurants who are asked to close and lose business, but evidently the caution (and surveillance) is still needed.   PS, I am also curious where the OP's home country is.

Those $280 tickets I scouted are now over $900 which makes me think I missed my window to get back to Chengdu.  This outbreak is going nuts in the US right now (deja vu?) and today is the day my siblings drove into town and we are remembering my mom. One sister and husband decided they will stay here for a week or as long as they need to (working from home). The other and her husband are heading back because his work isn't cancelled (.. yet! We have a bet).  I couldn't just take more students or rearrange my schedule because people who have been in lockdown in China and not working are not dishing out $$$ for online tutoring. Thankful for my normal paycheck+the editing+barebones of tutoring.  The wedding might be off? We still don't know.  Due to my mom's illness last year, we have a weirdly large amount of leftover medical supplies including masks and rubbing alcohol and rubber gloves, so I'm feeling prepped.  My dad and whole family are very healthy, so we are just going to sit and wait. Thanks for encouragement, guys. I was so anxious about getting murdered in the comments!!!",

Also the difference for them, assuming she's paying half of the au pair fee is $12,000. She earns $86,000 so the difference is $74,000.   BUILD WOMEN UP.

Also, remember that DC is ridiculously expensive. I'm a government employee and the last time I went I was blown away that prices at restaurants were all at least double to what I'm used to in Indianapolis. If these two lived elsewhere then every expense and their salaries would be deflated as well.",

I know all of these don't sound like a lot given you are also cooking, trying to control spending etc. But small things add up and there are ways to be mindful to reduce cost of activity without completely eliminating it out of budget.",

Who doesn't use coupons or the library when they're trying to save money, but still enjoy wine-filled HHs for balance?    One thing I didn't see in the diary was any long-term savings, like a 401k or Roth.  I know you're tackling your student loan debt, but start saving for your future to take advantage of that sweet compound interest.  Like going to the gym, it's a good habit and if you pay yourself first and put money away where you can't touch it, you learn to live on a leaner budget.  I love all your volunteer work with the doggies!!!!  One thought--if you want to tackle that CC debt faster, consider a side hustle working for Rover or some other kind of dog sitting.    In closing, you're awesome OP and I'd love to see where you are in a year with your CC debt and savings goals!",

OP, you are so awesome and as someone who's adopted three cats and volunteered at animal shelters, thank you for your time and hard work!   P.S. I totally identify with the struggle of a shopping problem - I specifically am vulnerable to shoes and handbags. I had a hard reality check last year. I realized that I had a habit of not only hiding all of my purchases from my husband but also lying about how much things cost (we keep separate financial accounts for fun spending / non-shared spending so it was lying about how I use my own money, but I was still so ashamed and worried he would judge me). What finally did the trick for me was diving really deep into living a more minimalist life and seeing that all of the material things I had made me feel anxious and claustrophobic. This is may be on the more extreme side of curbing a shopping problem, but maybe one worth exploring!   P.P.S. I love your point about supporting girlfriends on their accomplishments rather than only engagements, weddings, and babies. I'd love for more women to be valued in more complex ways!",

It's not easy to acknowledge areas that need some work and it sounds like you're doing a great job getting on top of it- awesome!  Just a tip that's worked for me: Try setting up your paycheck so that at least a small amount is deposited into a different account, or even multiple accounts. It's such an easy way to save money without trying, AND it psychologically makes you feel like you have less play money to spend in your checking account. Also it seems like the student loans/CC debt doesn't have to be an either/or thing...for example you could divert $250 of each paycheck into a separate account just to start chipping away at that. Best of luck, you're doing great!",

My one thing, and I see a few others mentioned it too is that you should really focus on the credit card debit before the student loans.  I get one is accruing interest, and the other isn't, but that's not the only factor.  If something happens (God forbid), and you can't pay off the CC before the 0% falls off, that'll be a big hit...also paying off the CC will help your credit score more than paying of the student loan.

Some stuff:  1) I invest 15% towards retirement (pre-tax) 2) I receive $2,400 a year from a family member for my student loans which I just received, so I now have 3K left. I have a CC debt snowball for the credit cards and have done a pretty good job of strategically timing out my payments so that by I'm CC debt free by Oct 2021, well before my 0% APR hits. I'm choosing to pay my student loans off first because I have a huge fear that I won't be able to get my shit together regarding my spending and I'm just afraid that I'll get myself out of CC debt and then slide right back in. At least my student loans will be GONE in 4 months. I recognize how tenuous it seems and honestly I have a lot of shame around this, but I'm doing really good in regards to working on this.  3) I did stop home for 30 minutes to hang with my dog between work &amp; the shelter! She also has my roommate &amp; her bf at home for some socialization. But I do feel bad for these long days.  4) My insurance is under my mom, which probably helps with the lower cost.",

In general, wish that Refinery would ensure OP‚Äôs  look at their pay stub to report their net paycheck, only deducting taxes. Then from the net paycheck, OP‚Äôs should report how much of the paycheck goes to their self chosen company retirement, personal retirement/investment, savings, and property rental plans.
