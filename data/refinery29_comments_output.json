I use this to cover my monthly chiropractor visits (Back pain, am I right?) and the leftover I plan to invest. My company offers investment plans at the end of each fiscal year to invest \"left over\" money from your HSA and I plan to take full advantage of that. My retirement is currently 3% of my income for now. I plan to up that come fall. As apart of my hire, I started at $50k a year and in 6 months (September) receive a $5k raise, so that will put my annual salary at $55,000 a year. They will reevaluate my income and put in for another raise once I graduate. I started at my company in June of 2019 as an intern, caught on very quickly, and got the opportunity to come on full time!   You all have been so amazing and supportive in the comments section!

After all the optimism of returning to normalcy, the last two days of this MD showed that this thing isn't really over.

They said that we will get the \"green light\" once local schools re-open, then teachers will have 3 weeks to get back to Chengdu. My fiance is still displaced in the south of China and the plan is for him to go back to Chengdu this month, update me, and I will make my way back. Those $280 tickets I scouted are now over $900 which makes me think I missed my window to get back to Chengdu.  This outbreak is going nuts in the US right now (deja vu?) and today is the day my siblings drove into town and we are remembering my mom. One sister and husband decided they will stay here for a week or as long as they need to (working from home). The other and her husband are heading back because his work isn't cancelled (.. yet! We have a bet).  I couldn't just take more students or rearrange my schedule because people who have been in lockdown in China and not working are not dishing out $$$ for online tutoring. Thankful for my normal paycheck+the editing+barebones of tutoring.  The wedding might be off? We still don't know.  Due to my mom's illness last year, we have a weirdly large amount of leftover medical supplies including masks and rubbing alcohol and rubber gloves, so I'm feeling prepped.  My dad and whole family are very healthy, so we are just going to sit and wait. Thanks for encouragement, guys. I was so anxious about getting murdered in the comments!!!",

Everything has started shutting down in Toronto, and I worry so much about my parents. I loved how you cooked so much at home for both you and him.

I am so sorry to hear about your current separation from your fianc√© and the uncertainty surrounding your wedding.  I cannot even imagine would that would be like.  I feel like this is tiny in the face of all your challenges, but have you heard of Watch Party? It‚Äôs a chrome extension that lets you sync up your Netflix viewing with your friends.

I also loved reading her thoughts on money and her relationship with money throughout the diary.  Who hasn't felt like a baller after payday and gone a little crazy the weekend after payday?  Who doesn't use coupons or the library when they're trying to save money, but still enjoy wine-filled HHs for balance?    One thing I didn't see in the diary was any long-term savings, like a 401k or Roth.  I know you're tackling your student loan debt, but start saving for your future to take advantage of that sweet compound interest.  Like going to the gym, it's a good habit and if you pay yourself first and put money away where you can't touch it, you learn to live on a leaner budget.  I love all your volunteer work with the doggies!!!!  One thought--if you want to tackle that CC debt faster, consider a side hustle working for Rover or some other kind of dog sitting.    In closing, you're awesome OP and I'd love to see where you are in a year with your CC debt and savings goals!",

OP, you are so awesome and as someone who's adopted three cats and volunteered at animal shelters, thank you for your time and hard work!   P.S. I totally identify with the struggle of a shopping problem - I specifically am vulnerable to shoes and handbags. I had a hard reality check last year. I realized that I had a habit of not only hiding all of my purchases from my husband but also lying about how much things cost (we keep separate financial accounts for fun spending / non-shared spending so it was lying about how I use my own money, but I was still so ashamed and worried he would judge me). What finally did the trick for me was diving really deep into living a more minimalist life and seeing that all of the material things I had made me feel anxious and claustrophobic. This is may be on the more extreme side of curbing a shopping problem, but maybe one worth exploring!   P.P.S. I love your point about supporting girlfriends on their accomplishments rather than only engagements, weddings, and babies. I'd love for more women to be valued in more complex ways!",

It's not easy to acknowledge areas that need some work and it sounds like you're doing a great job getting on top of it- awesome!  Just a tip that's worked for me: Try setting up your paycheck so that at least a small amount is deposited into a different account, or even multiple accounts. It's such an easy way to save money without trying, AND it psychologically makes you feel like you have less play money to spend in your checking account. Also it seems like the student loans/CC debt doesn't have to be an either/or thing...for example you could divert $250 of each paycheck into a separate account just to start chipping away at that. Best of luck, you're doing great!",

My one thing, and I see a few others mentioned it too is that you should really focus on the credit card debit before the student loans.  I get one is accruing interest, and the other isn't, but that's not the only factor.  If something happens (God forbid), and you can't pay off the CC before the 0% falls off, that'll be a big hit...also paying off the CC will help your credit score more than paying of the student loan.

Some stuff:  1) I invest 15% towards retirement (pre-tax) 2) I receive $2,400 a year from a family member for my student loans which I just received, so I now have 3K left. I have a CC debt snowball for the credit cards and have done a pretty good job of strategically timing out my payments so that by I'm CC debt free by Oct 2021, well before my 0% APR hits. I'm choosing to pay my student loans off first because I have a huge fear that I won't be able to get my shit together regarding my spending and I'm just afraid that I'll get myself out of CC debt and then slide right back in. At least my student loans will be GONE in 4 months. I recognize how tenuous it seems and honestly I have a lot of shame around this, but I'm doing really good in regards to working on this.  3) I did stop home for 30 minutes to hang with my dog between work &amp; the shelter! She also has my roommate &amp; her bf at home for some socialization. But I do feel bad for these long days.  4) My insurance is under my mom, which probably helps with the lower cost.",

I wasn't going to comment much at first but I just wanted to say thank you for the kind words and the encouragement- I wasn't sure how my MD would be taken. Y'all are very very sweet.   I mainly wanted to say that I 'm NOT an anti-vaxxer or an anti flu-shot person or any of that and that I take public health very seriously. Interesting how that started spreading on here! Please don't assume this about everyone who lives a little differently.  And if anything I said came out uppity or moralistic as I think someone called it, I apologize. I am still unlearning a lot from a family of origin that labeled a lot of things as good or bad. I promise I am only referring to things like harsh oven cleaner, drain cleaner, and the excessive amounts of drugs and alcohol I was consuming prior to sobriety. All of it is a personal choice and I'm far from perfect. You do you! Obviously!  Also sorry about the foot bath. I guess I didn't realize how weird that was!  Xoxo- SoupPot",

A couple of things that helped me: my OBGYN recommended I start taking a supplement called Oncovite, which I started taking before the procedure... when they biopsied the tissue they removed from me, my doc told me that the abnormal cells were gone, and I‚Äôve had clear paps ever since. I absolutely know everyone has a different experience and no two bodies are the same, but I wanted to share some of my experience and offer a bit of hope. Secondly, I strongly believe that my aggressive efforts to drastically minimize the stress in my life played a huge role in keeping me healthy. I was also working as a designer, and also had dreams of becoming a freelance photographer full-time. I think my job was putting invisible stress on me, and ironically when I did quit that job and start freelancing (which is what I do now, full time) it took away the stress...I think because I am earning more, even though it isn‚Äôt a ‚Äústeady‚Äù paycheck.

I totally understand wanting to try something that claims to boost your immune system or claims to be ‚Äúanti-cancer.‚Äù  Illness and cancer are scary, and it would be nice to think we could cure them with magic diets. It just doesn‚Äôt work that way (though certain cancers.. eg colon cancer.. are linked to certain less healthy diets).   I hope you got the answers you wanted from your colposcopy.

Also had a colonoscopy and was given all of the general advice about the body naturally clearing HPV. I'm now 30 and the last few paps I've had have been clear!  One thing that I don't see mentioned in this thread and that finally clicked for me was that even if you are taking all of the vitamins in this world, reducing your stress etc. if you're still sleeping with the same guy and not using condoms, chances are that you will continue to be reinfected with the HPV.  My gyno had advised me that I should be using condoms with my boyfriend, at least until I'd cleared the virus, I ignored her advice at that time. It wasn't until I broke up with the boyfriend I was with during my abnormal paps that I noticed that all my paps since about 6 months post breakup have been clear. Honestly everything else about my lifestyle and health has stayed the same.  This might be obvious, but I wanted to share what I've learned from my own experience (and lack of listening to professionals in the first place!) in case it makes a difference to someone going through the stress of abnormal paps :)",

I'm 25, and have been getting abnormal pap smears for the last several years because I have high-risk HPV. I have strains 16 and 18, the two strains that have the highest possibility to make my cervical cells become cancerous. I'm surprised that you had a colposcopy done at 23‚Äîthat's pretty young, and most gynos don't recommend those until you're at least 25 because your immune system is stronger when you're younger. I got my first colposcopy done this year, and it was the scariest thing I've ever had to do. My results from my colposcopy (to make a very long, boring story short) stated that even though I have abnormal cells on my cervix, they're pretty much dormant, so I just need to get a pap smear done every year. As scary and terrifying abnormal paper smears are,I want you to know that it honestly is totally normal. You're doing the right thing in getting it checked out and monitored though. The more you stay on top of it, the higher your recovery is IF they find something in the future. I do want to also reassure you just because you have abnormal cells on your cervix, that doesn't mean that you're GOING to get cervical cancer. It just means those cells COULD. COULD doesn't mean WILL. As long as you're taking good care of yourself, eating right, exercising, doing things to boost your immune system, and going to regular doctor's appointments, I PROMISE you you will be okay. :-) You've got this!",

(Although I know it's hard to predict what the world will look like in August).  The first year of law school is hard and causes mental health issues galore- and that is even when you're able to be there in person, to make friends with your classmates, etc. I am graduating from law school in a few weeks and I can't think of anything worse or more challenging than starting your first semester of law school online.  In my opinion, it would be better to wait a year and have an in-person law school experience all the way through.",

However, I wish people would use the world \"privileged\" instead of \"lucky\" when referring to parental or family support.  \"Lucky\" makes it sound random, whereas \"privileged\" acknowledges the systems in place (racism, classism, etc.) that allow some families to accrue and pass on wealth and opportunity to their children.  I say this as a person who has privilege both by birth and by marriage.  I have worked somewhat hard for the things I have, but I have also achieved financial stability and comfort because I have ALWAYS had some sort of safety net, and opportunities available to me because of my privileged status.  Just my two cents and again I don't mean to pick on you OP, I just hope to change the conversation around privilege!",

Second, 10-12 weeks is the hardest time and be prepared for damage to your apartment. This is essential where your kittens are in their toddler phase. They will be rambunctious so rambunctious. Finally if you have a cat that hisses when you come near, and is scared try putting a little wet food on your fingers. It will lead to a positive association.

I had to talk to a friend of mine who is going out every other day (and her husband goes to work everyday etc...) because she says if you're using essential businesses it's okay to go out whenever. It's not. Make a list and stock up. Make coffee at home. You can order at Target on the app on your phone and just pick up as well, which is helpful. Way more people are high risk than many people realize (not you specifically, I think generally people don't realize it) Just having asthma puts you at high risk but someone I loved who was not old or high risk died yesterday so what does it even mean to not be high risk at this point?

It‚Äôs not difficult to understand. Either straight up say you don‚Äôt care enough or just do it. Don‚Äôt go trying to make excuses. This is how it works. Your roommate is moving back and forth between your place and her BFs. Does her BF ever see anyone else? Does he have a roommate? Does Y ever see anyone else? Does he have a roommate? The whole point of social distancing is that it only takes one asymptomatic person to spread. If we all pick 1-2 people who we think it‚Äôs safe to go outside and see, then this is already pointless.   In this scenario, your roommate should just go move in with her BF and you should just move in with yours and that‚Äôs the end of that.",

NYC is also always going to be a priority on the food supply chain and in terms of medical innovation.   You are privileged to be able to stay home in your apartment and have health insurance - therefore, you are as safe in NY as you would be anywhere.

I promise you'll regret it. There is absolutely nothing wrong with parents or boyfriends or whoever that pays for stuff, I don't understand why it offends people so much. The OP isn't expecting any of this to be paid, her family just wants to do it for her. My SO and I make a combined salary of $500k plus and my parents would sooner pick a fight then ever let us pay for dinner. But on the back end I would never ask my parents to pay me back for anything, we work as one family unit. I find it weird when parents or vice versa children keep count of who owes what. We have very deep rooted take care of each other mentality. OP I think you're doing great, don't let these haters get you down, they're just jealous.",

It looks like the state of emergency was declared in KC around the same time as NYC and the idea of going to the gym or visiting friends' houses by that point definitely felt like it was completely out of the question. I know people are feeling like all of the coronavirus/quarantine MDs are sort of redundant but I do think it's been pretty eye-opening to see how different areas of the country have responded to the outbreak. It definitely helps you understand how this thing was able to spread the way it has.  On a lighter note... why is referring to Taco Bell as supper the funniest thing to me?",

This is just as unhelpful to homeowners as it is to renters, unfortunately.   I think everyone's got a hardship right now - homeowners have mortgage issues, renters have rent issues, hell even frontline workers have issues working the frontline!  OP - maybe you can ask your landlord to spread the month's payment over the rest of your lease? Easier to handle vs a balloon payment to be sure. The landlord will <em eventually</em  get their money, and it'll be less hardship on you.",

I do think that OP realizes overall how great her privilege is at not having any debt and owning her apartment. It might be forgotten in moments where she expects her friends in Big Law to cover more of the tab (while forgetting that although they may have huge salaries, many of them probably also have huge huge debt and less overall privileges than she does.)But alas, we're all human and we all have our moments.

Disclaimer, I am from Central Europe so a lot of the American discourse on taxes and especially the ‚Äúyou only deserve what you pay‚Äù mentality  sounds outright crazy to me. 1. Tax equality is not only about taxing earnings proportionally. If you have fixed taxes, such as value added taxes for food and stuff, high earners have a proportionally lower tax burden. Same if you don‚Äôt tax certain things that are more common with wealthy people, such as earnings from interest. I am sure that proportionally to your income, you don‚Äôt pay a lesser percentage in taxes. 2. The right to receive medical care should never ever be tied to contributions. Which is why a state cannot be run like a company. Please don‚Äôt ever feel shame for receiving medical care. It is a states responsibility for its citizens to provide it and the real shame in my opinion is that so many countries are failing in that aspect.",
