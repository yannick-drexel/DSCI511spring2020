I’ve taken a break from reading R29 diaries because I was starting to feel so down about myself - especially compared to all the 23 year olds making $100k a year with $75k in savings and no debt.

We just need to remember that we’re all on our own journeys and will (hopefully) get to where we need to be.","For people in SF / the Bay Area, I started compiling this thread of black-owned restaurants yesterday! https://www.reddit.com/r/AskSF/comments/gtjn7o/blackowned_restaurants_coffee_shops_available_for/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf",[deleted],"Bless you for putting so much time into this, I can’t wait to read these all!","I would love to see a wider range of incomes, jobs, locations, debt, savings, etc in the diaries, but they'd probably need to do a much better job at monitoring the comments if that is the case. The comments can be brutal to anyone who isn't making an above average salary or who has a lot of debt. It can scare off people from submitting. 

I grew up in a small town and I'd love to see more small town, low cost of living diaries, but it seems whenever those are posted the comments call it boring, or tear the diarist apart for eating at a chain restaurant.","Honestly sometimes I think people who volunteer to do MD are often people who are quite proud of their accomplishments and of what they do and have a rather enviable situation. Or else people who have a really poor situation (lots of debt - but often a good job!) and want to show what they are doing to fix it.

I'm the same age as you. I cook nice meals... every now and then. My diet is currently mostly toasted bread with butter and cheese (sometimes I only eat that for DAYS). I don't exercise - I didn't before the pandemic, why start now... I get up late and I stay up late watching YouTube videos. When I work I am able to be a bit more productive, but these days while I have been furloughed, I have regressed into a teenager... 

I bet you most people have these things but no one posts about it. My MD this week would be something like:  


Monday - Friday - nothing  
Saturday - Went to the shop, queued for 15 minutes, bought milk, bread, vegetables, baked beans and cheese. £12.50   
Sunday - Nothing

I just want to suggest saving a little more :) your expenses are mostly all covered so you could really rack up a great nest egg if you made the choice to cut frivolous spending a little bit! IE cut the random blowout, a cab ride, and $20 on gym membership that you never use you could have saved $50 this week! That would translate to an extra $2400 in a year.","Mine wasn't that heavily edited, but they did take out my husband's often debilitating chronic illness.  It made it look like he was useless around the house for no good reason.  I could totally tell they did it to stir up drama. It would be nice if they let you read their changes before they posted it..","I agree the comments here this week have been pretty rough. Commenters here were hard on the Mormon woman too.

If it was up to me, this sub would be “mostly personal finance” with a heavy emphasis on the personal part. I’m all for chatting about skincare or workout classes or manicures or whatever is important to you. I don’t know of a lot of spaces on Reddit where women can come and talk about our money issues and choices in a supportive environment. I don’t think we need another gossip subreddit where people nitpick appearance and lifestyle choices — if people want to do that, at least limit it to public figures who have sort of submitted themselves to the scrutiny.

I don’t have my thoughts together on this. But I’d support rules discouraging hateful and personal comments. And banning doxxing for sure.","well ladies, get ready for my post about the grocery store life! i wasn't approved last month but i might just post anyways lol",I had to stop reading so many because I was being really hard on myself for stupid stuff.

Just because there is an organic option doesn’t mean there is a GMO counterpart. An organic avocado vs a non-labeled avocado does not make it a GMO avocado for example, it’s just a different farming practice (and a GMO avocado doesn’t exist). A lot of local small farmers also don’t pay to get the organic certification because it does cost but they might have a similar farming practice. There are 10 approved GMO crops in the US. They are: 

Squash, soy beans, corn, cotton, papaya, canola, alfalfa, sugar beets, potatoes, apples.

Also mad respect to you and S for being mature about introductions, I'm glad movie night went well! :)

This was a really wonderful read.",I’ll admit I missed getting a more robust diary. Especially since you’re such a high earner I would have loved to read a little about your workdays. I enjoyed the way you laid out the top section and found it easy to follow. And of course your family money story is fascinating. Great perspective. Thank you for sharing.,"I'd be interested in a money diary from a girlfriend of a professional athlete. Specifically girlfriend because it doesn't fall into the ""what's mine is yours"" area of a spouse. I've always been curious if some get an allowance or who pays for the travel/accommodations when traveling for games, or any other purchases that come up while dating someone who lives a (stereotypical) flashy lifestyle.","Regrets: 

- was definitely overly ambitious on my original food stock up and bought some stuff that went to waste and I felt bad about it. 


Wins: 

- I bought both of my cats harnesses and leashes and now I take them on walks in my backyard when it is nice. They were nervous at first but now I think it is the best part of all of our days!","Hi there!  Sending you a virtual hug...remember that this is TEMPORARY and we will all be back to normal someday.

I'm feeling the effects of it as well- I listed my condo RIGHT before this hit, and I can't close on my new place yet.  So I feel stuck in neutral- I had hoped to build a liquid emergency fund this year, which obviously isn't happening.

Good luck to everyone else on here that's feeling a little stressed right now!  Glad to have this supportive forum.","First of all, congrats! That’s an awesome jump in salary! I’m not sure how old you are or what stage in life you are. That will make a difference in how you budget. I think first things first is to establish an emergency fund, then pay down any debt you may have, and then start saving for retirement/ other goals. The personal finance subreddit has a very thorough wiki about all those steps.  

With any jump in salary, I would recommend to try to live like you’re still making 40k. Lifestyle inflation is real and could really get in the way of your financial goals!","Kind of similar but what about top goals that people have set/achieved as a result of this sub? 

And maybe a top financial No No’s that people have learnt as a result of this sub? 

And also what about top workplace advice people have learnt from this sub? I personally love that some of these posts have come up, I love the perspectives and glean some really useful advice from other people.","Wow! I am so sorry to hear about your situation. I am glad that you and your family seem to be doing well, all things considered. This hits close to home for me too, based on your comment history I probably only live a short drive from you. 
What kind of “mild” symptoms have you been experiencing? I feel like that is one of the most challenging things—we are told to look out for fever, shortness of breath, and coughing, but it sounds like it’s so common for people to be “silently” infected. 
Best wishes and positive thoughts to you.","This was a great read :) 

For what it’s worth my parents were immigrants and are Canadian citizens now. My dad always dreams about retiring back to India. He loves Canada and all of the privileges it’s afforded him but there’s no place like home, and it just depends on where home is! Your mom is right - you and your sister are happy, healthy, smart, and successful, so she can go be in peace back home now!","Extremely interested in this. Women in high earning and successful careers should be more willing to mentor and assist each other in some capacity. Men have always done this for each other professionally, hence the term *old boys club*. Competitiveness with other women is still in effect from trick down patriarchy. In the wonderful spirit of the progressiveness of MD, I think it would be in alignment to also share career diaries and advice with each other.",A fluffy duvet/comforter and all white bedding - it feels like I'm sleeping in a hotel bed,"I appreciate you sharing, especially when under the stress of working in a grocery store right now! I hope you get good news from your last interview and a pay raise is in your future. You really deserve more than $5 a day hazard pay.","I plugged into alumni groups of organizations that I did in college. I am also a Christian, so I joined an online bible study that meets through Zoom. I try to have at least one meaningful (emphasis on meaningful, not just a check in ""hey hope you're doing ok"") conversation (mostly through text) per day. Surface level conversations are fine, but you should also have deep, meaningful conversations as much as you can. I do a good amount of videochatting. I also have YouTube videos, podcasts, or Netflix playing in the background pretty much all day. A few years ago, I suffered through what I like to call ""a period of crushing loneliness"" and I honestly owe my life to the TV shows I played in the background for noise. Just hearing the sound of other voices, especially multiple people involved in conversations with each other, helped calm my racing mind and heart. Sports are also good for this--plenty of full NFL games on YouTube (probably other sports too, but I'm partial to football so that's what I used). 

Also, it's important to *plan* an ""activity"" for you to do each day. For example, my plan for the week was Monday: Animal Crossing; Tuesday: read; Wednesday: coloring book; Thursday, watch Tiger King. The most important part of this is the pre-planning, not necessarily sticking to it. It gives you structure, but more importantly it gives you something to hold on to when you feel yourself spiraling. On Monday, I played my game, but I also read and did laundry. Let's say I wake up tomorrow and I feel myself spiraling downward. I can look at my list of things I've planned and say ""Ok it's Thursday, time to watch Tiger King.""","I’ve definitely been spending more on groceries either buying comfort food or trying out new desserts I never would have otherwise... And then I wind up spending more on cooking tools or apps for more recipes. 

I figure if I’m not spending money on other things I can afford to splurge on food — not the best mindset. 😂",That amount is only information. Nothing more! Not a bad reflection of your character. Take that information and decide what you want to do with it without shaming yourself,"Yes, yes, so much yes. I used to work at a fast food restaurant as a cook. I was constantly exhausted and the work was hard because it was one of the busiest locations in my country. I was always in tears after my shift because management were rough too. Now I have a cushy desk job where I get an hour lunch and I can come and go pretty much as I please for things like coffee and snacks. I get paid at least 4x more for a way easier job that just requires a few ~specialized skills~. You could not pay me enough to go back to fast food, retail, anything like that. People who work undesirable, exhausting jobs deserve to have better pay.",Gah this was so good and I totally feel you on the dating scene. It's so rough at times... Also we really need to organize an /r/MoneyDiariesACTIVE meetup in NYC,"Last year I bought a simplehuman trash can/recycler for $200 and it has been *life changing*. People come over and I literally show it off and demonstrate it's features. 

This is the [trash can](https://www.simplehuman.com/rectangular-liner-pocket-step-can#finish/brushed/size/58L-recycler).","Ugh this is me. I’ve been paying $2000 a month, and still have about 4 more months to go. I track it using an Excel sheet and it’s just so satisfying highlighting and recording the payment I made that month. I can’t wait to be done.","Honestly social distancing has overall shown me that I really don't need much face to face interaction. I like staying home and I don't miss the pressure of feeling like I'm a loser if I don't have plans every weekend. 

I live alone, no pets or anything, but I just don't feel lonely. I have friends who live far away, and I text with them every day and video chat now and then. I text with my sisters most days too, and check in with my dad every week. Plus I message with coworkers. I feel supported and cared for.

Also, this may sound weird but I like not being seen. I like not worrying how I look or feeling pressure to be put together.

Also I love not having to pack a lunch for work.",[deleted],"I’m in Chicago and since summer is approaching, here are a few of my warm weather recommendations for visitors or locals who want to fall in love with the city again. 

$0-15
- Go to morning yoga or an evening concert in Millennium Park (free)
- Go for a walk or rent a Divvy bike and cruise down the Lakeshore Trail; picnic on one of the beaches
- Go to any of the farmers markets (all over the city on different days) for brunch or dinner from a local restaurant
- Visit Harold Washington Library (free)
- Visit Lincoln Park Zoo (free)
- Buy: Co-op hot sauces, coffee from Dark Matter, non-tacky souvenir swag from Transit Tees

$15-50
- Architecture Boat Tour is on the high end of this (maybe $45-50/ticket) but consistently amazing and worth it. 
- Go to a concert at Thalia Hall and have a drink at the Tack Room (same building)
- Any rooftop bar or brewery patio! Chicago has a great beer scene. You could visit “Malt Row” in the Ravenswood/North Center neighborhood and visit a few. 
- Visit Quimby’s bookstore in Wicker Park and check out their collection of zines; follow with a burger or martinis at the Blue Line Lounge

$100+ 
- If were really splurging, dinner at Alinea will set you back in the +++ range! But honestly, Chicago’s food scene is incredible, so dinner out is a must, but you have dozens of options that are awesome but cheaper.
- Cocktails at the Violet Hour if you want quality drinks, at the Aviary if you want more of a show 
- Take the Metra (commuter train) up to Ravinia and get lawn tickets to a concert, bring your own picnic and booze","""I swear I don't usually eat out this often/drink this much Starbucks/spend this much money. This was an unusual week""","This calculator says I'm in the top 10% of my country based on household income. That is very weird to think of, since I just started making my salary 6 months ago, it's nowhere near 6 figure range, and I grew up severely poor.

Edit to add that I just ran the numbers based on my family of origin's info. We were 5 people and my parents together made less than 60k (i used that just to make it easy) and apparently we were right at the 40% mark. It's crazy to think we were wealthier than 40% of households because we were struggling","- I budget monthly to spend money on clothing 
- after my normal budget extra money goes into goal savings (right now I’m building an emergency fund) 
- I’ve made peace with the idea that I might not be a homeowner for 10-20 more years but it’s definitely something I hope to work on someday

You should definitely go to your local credit union and see what first time homebuyer stuff there is in your state. Some states even have matched IDAs where they will match money you put into house savings.","Yay Christine McConnell!

Also kudos for sucking it up and switching to the pavement. They closed all of our trails and I'd rather deal with the ancient elliptical in the basement than go back to road running. My ITBS thanks me but it is so boring.","Solo city dweller here. I have a 1920s one bedroom, so a pretty generous size for one (650ish sqft) by big city standards. Honestly I think if I were in a smaller town I would be SO isolated and alone and scared. At least here I have the comforting sounds of human life (my neighbours taking their dogs out, listening to music, running their blenders), and all the necessities (grocery, pharmacy) are walkable, and there are delivery services if I ever get stuck at home and can’t leave.","I really appreciate that you shared this and truly believe that you can do it-one of the hardest things in the world is to open up and share even part of your story, and it's really kickass that you  did that! As someone who has struggled with an eating disorder most of their life and has frequently sought solace in the stories of others online, I commend you for being brave enough to connect with us on here-I know it isn't easy. Be gentle to yourself, and do not feel guilty about where you are or where you have been in life. We are all working to do better on here and fighting different battles, and recovery is an ongoing and often exhausting process that is incredibly hard but incredibly worth it. I've personally found the Money Diaries community on here to be a breath of fresh air, filled with way more support and understanding than I'd expect. Keep your head up!","I practice the 48 hours rule. If I feel the urge to buy something I want (not need), I wait 48 hours and if I still have that same urge then I buy it. That allowed me to stop buying about 90% of things that I used to spend frivolously on. 
I also budget for vacation and gifts monthly which allows me to stop impulse buying because I actually have to wait to accumulate money.
All that takes a lot of discipline and might take years so don’t beat up yourself!","R29 had one in May of 2018, she was from Alaska. She was so unbelievably smug and there was no reasoning with her in the comments section. 

I just don't think we would get a truthful account since most caught up in an MLM don't realize what a scam it is. I would like to hear some type of recap from someone that recently escaped though.",Holy shit. I wish I didn’t hate programming so much.,"Interesting to see a diary from India! You seem to be doing a great job with the finances. :)


I have always wondered what home prices are like in an Indian city with a booming tech industry. You mention that you have about 14K left on the home mortgage - would you mind mentioning how much you bought the home for?","How did it get created? I found it and subbed the same day, back in October. Thanks to this sub I have completely overhauled my finances, figured out a savings strategy to save three months of an E fund and should be debt free by the end of 2020! (Covid permitting...) 

I love this place for being the friendliest, most supportive career and finance corner I have found on the internet.","I cannot wrap my head around someone panic-cashing-out their 401k at 39, especially if that's your only real form of ""savings"".

I will probably get some work done when I get into my forties and I know other women who have done the same. But man, it’s fucking exhausting being a woman. Men have it so much easier.

I believe some people call them “bars”, but to me it’s just a misunderstood square.",I feel like the people in the American diaries are super organised about saving for retirement and having investments. I don’t think that is a thing for people in Europe or the U.K. until you hit your 30’s? (Or maybe me and all my friends are just highly irresponsible!),"I think this is both the best time and the worst time to make insane or seemingly rational but actually pretty major for YOU decisions. 

I mean in my honest opinion most of the posts are from people who have been wanting to do X thing for a while and feel like the middle of a pandemic is the perfect excuse to say fuck it. I kind of agree. 

In the routine of normal life, it's easy to say everything is fine, I'm fine, my hair is fine, my body is fine, the boyfriend I hate is fine, the shitting city I live in fine, my crap job is fine. But like if it's not? Then its not and you should change that. 

Either way no matter what happens now or going forward, in 5 years you'll still be five years older and that's time and opportunity that you can never get back for better or worse. I would hate for things to go back to being miserable if that's what it was for them pre-COVID.

But definitely dont dump your stocks. That's a definite no. And dont spend all your savings on useless crap.","ONE OF US. ONE OF US. 😂 congrats, that is wild!",This should be interesting with everyone eating at home more and going to the grocery store less! I know my food choices have been interesting lately..,"This really is so true. I remember this time after I bought a really expensive pair of shoes (Frye boots), and someone asked me how much they were. I said they were $300, and immediately a lot of the guys in the group basically started shaming me for spending that much on shoes (all the ""women be spending money on useless things""). My wonderful friend immediately piped up to one of the guys in the group and was like, ""well what's your monthly payment on your new sports car? You know LadyPeterWimsey bought her car with cash?""

It really took them aback. The fact that I could be financially responsible and also own $300 shoes - madness I tell you! And that men and women spend money very differently, but the 20-something guy wasn't shamed for buying his $40k sports car, but the 20-something girl was for her $300 shoes.",Hey OP.

I am taking advantage of being able to take multiple 30+ minute walks a day. In the morning I go out listening to the Daily, then I go out again around post-lunch, then a post-dinner walk and sometimes with a friend/neighbor.

I think when life goes back to normal, I will definitely keep to the post-dinner walk. It's a helpful way to close the day.","I think it really depends what industry you're in. Tech industry in particular - many of the larger companies offer tons of perks because companies have to compete for top talent, and if Company A offers a set of perks, Company B needs to offer similar (or better) to be able to lure staff. 

In a more cynical view, those perks are often a trade-off in exchange to tip your work-life balance more toward the ""work"" column, and also to increase length of service from employees, because you can get accustomed to a lifestyle that would be hard to walk away from. A lot of people talk about how facebook/google etc offer tons of stuff on their campuses, but it's also so you feel ""taken care of"" in exchange for an exacting, strenuous work environment and long hours. Having a company cell phone often means being expected to be ""on call"" 24/7 if needed, etc. 

I'm in tech and my company offers very few perks (we have a fitness stipend, $500/year, but that's pretty much it - and was done to stay competitive with orgs we tended to lose people to) because we're a small outfit, but sometimes ""perks"" look different. My previous job was low-pay with lots of perks and very generous vacation time (6 weeks PTO), but the ""grind culture"" was real and my mental health was a shambles. In comparison I have fewer perks now, but I'm paid a livable wage and our management have a strong commitment to not burning people out, and management is very proactive about it - and IMO that's worth more to me than free lunch.","Interesting question! I never spend on coffee out unless I’ve been given a gift card. I also don’t have a car or pets! 

My biggest niche expense is taking my friends out to celebrate my birthday. Last year I spent $1300 to take myself and fourteen people out to a tapas dinner with an open bar. One friend even flew in from out of town! I was always jealous of kids that got presents or got to celebrate their birthdays and I also think it’d be weird or prohibitive to host something in my own honor and expect my friends to pay for it so I save $150/month to be able to do something extravagant.

Some people put $0 towards savings of any kind. Some people are perpetually in credit card debt. Some people save 50% of their income, others just go for the company match on their 401k and don't save a penny further. Some have secure generational wealth.

You're right that some things will be easier, BUT  you're likely going to have a really hard time finding a new job over the next few months (somewhat dependent on your field of course). If you have the opportunity to work remotely and keep your salary right now, it would be foolish not too. Use this time to fix up your resume, work on certifications, and even take interviews privately if anyone is hiring.

When just one woman breaks that barrier, it means we are one step closer to pay equality and gender equality. That is one less woman who will need to stay in an abusive relationship because she relies on her SO for support, one less woman who will take BS, one less woman likely to get murdered via domestic violence. For young women, having financial independence is so incredibly important, I can't overstate its significance. I come from a home with an emotionally abusive, misogynistic,  controlling father and not until I started making $200k did I finally feel I could completely cut off contact with him altogether because it meant I wouldn't need to rely on him again.","Yes! I take one at least once per quarter. It’s a day to take myself to breakfast, see a movie, get a facial and generally just decompress. I encourage my team to do the same. It’s not weakness; I think we all forget that our jobs don’t own us just because they pay us. If sick time and PTO are part of your benefits, use them!","The infamous co-op thief!!!

**How?**

Python, mostly


**Why?**

Boredom, mostly. Hoping this sparks some discussion. Happy to answer questions or provide links to specific diaries.



**Summary**


The median age is 27. The mean age is 27.77. The mode age is 30.

The youngest diarist is [20](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/university-student-new-york-ny-tuition-salary-money-diary) and the oldest is [48](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/communications-specialist-baltimore-salary).

The median salary is $62,473. The mean salary is $93,135. The mode salary is $60,000.^1

Most (92%) gave income annually. 

* Of these, the lowest-paid were [a person receiving $7,548 in disability payments](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/disability-texas-salary-money-diary), a [""nomad"" making $12,000](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/nomad-western-united-states-salary-money-diary), and an [AmeriCorps member making $14,850](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/americorps-eastern-utah-salary-money-diary).
* The three highest were joint incomes: [a surgeon making $655,000](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/surgeon-washington-dc-salary-money-diary), [a cafe owner making $610,000](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/cafe-owner-san-francisco-ca-salary-money-diary), and [an attorney making $520,000](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/attorney-dallas-tx-salary-money-diary).
* I think there may have been higher numbers if bonuses were included.


Six (4%) listed income hourly.

* The lowest was [$16.75/hour](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/behavioral-health-coordinator-illinois-salary-money-diary) and highest was [$100/hour](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/consultant-chicago-salary-money-diary).
* There were a few others who listed various hourly jobs in the ""Salary"" field, including some students, but depending on where they listed things I didn't capture all of them.

Six (4%) had no income, due to being a student, on [medical leave](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/medical-leave-chicago-il-salary-money-diary), or [being](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/unemployed-nyc-salary-money-diary) [unemployed](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/unemployed-los-angeles-ca-money-diary).

To no one's surprise, the most common location was New York, NY (22, or 15%). 

* This includes people who listed Brooklyn (4), New York, NY/New Jersey (1), and Queens (2), but not Buffalo (1) or Long Island (1). I'm told New Yorkers are passionate about definitions of New York but I'm not familiar so feel free to correct me.
* Second most common was Washington, D.C. with 8 diaries (5%) which also gets the dubious distinction of most variations on city name formatting (4).
* Next is Los Angeles, CA with 7 (5%).
* I didn't attempt to group metro areas.


Only 10 (7%) of diaries were international.

* Countries included Japan (1), Israel (1), Australia (3), China (1), South Korea (1), South Africa (1), England (1), and Denmark (1).


**Other numbers**


* Unemployed diarists: 2
* Most common occupations: Account Manager (3), Account Executive (3), Project Manager (3)

^1 Note: The salary number is from the ""Today, an [occupation] who makes [salary]..."" intro and often includes a partner's income. Where hourly income was given, I multiplied the paycheck amount by the paycheck frequency to get an annual number. I excluded one [student diary](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/student-university-michigan-tuition-college-money-diary) where I could not be fussed to work out a number.","I just wanted to take a moment to thank all the average- and low-earning posters on this sub.  I think it's easy to lose sight of reality in an environment like this where many of the participants make amounts well above the national average.  Not everyone can max out their 401k, pay a $4k mortgage, or go on expensive vacations, but that doesn't mean that you can't make smart financial decisions at every income level.

Overall this community is pretty supportive, but I think a lot of low- and average-income folks feel uncomfortable being a part of the conversation. So hats off to those of you who share!

From,
a fellow average-earner.

Edit: I didn't expect this post to get as much traction as it did, and I'm glad to know that a lot of people have the same sort of self-doubt that I do.  I originally started reading MDs because I thought it was a really empowering way to break down taboos around finances.  Now the conversation seems to deviate a lot more often into social voyeurism.  I'm going to do my best to participate more and add my realities to the conversation in the future.","I think mindful spending is an important and productive way to continue to support BIPOC not just today, but as a way to integrate allyship into our everyday lives. 

Let's share our favourite black-owned restaurants, beauty brands, lifestyle stores, etc!","I have been reading money diaries for so long and honestly, so many things have surprised me.

I am a black 26 year old woman with a black male partner. He grew up blue collar and I grew up financially struggling (but socially white collar). We both had horrible examples of managing money growing up - his mom was evicted a few times in his childhood, my mom was an unexpectedly single mom of 5 kids, etc. Most of the people I knew were financially struggling as well. We have student loan debt, a bit of credit card debt, both making very low or average salaries (me 55k and him 60k) in a high cost of living city. Everything we have, will come from us. Every trip, subscription, phone bill, anythinggg comes from just the two of us. On top of it all, our family asks us for money sometimes. 

I thought this was normal but I was also confused as to how people making the same salary could just DO so much more. College friends and money diaries blows my mind how common it is for certain segments of the population to have their parents/grandparents help them with savings, down payments, even ""frivolous"" things like fun subscriptions or a family vacation where they don't have to pay. And honestly, it's hard to not feel pissed sometimes. If I had known that most people have help or marry high-earner partners, I would have maybe said eff it to what I really want to do for a career, (international Dev) and just chased money. 

But then I remember that this mentality robs me of the joy I have now. Like honestly, things are good and I don't feel bad until I start seeing what other people have. Sooo this really long rant that kinda has no point is to say that I am going to step away from money diaries for a while - and for people who are feeling the same way, don't beat yourself up about having the diaries make you feel resentful. This could just be the push to put down money diaries too and maybe continue to fight for the right policy changes!","I definitely underestimated how much time it would take to read all those diaries. A few things I noticed after starting all the way from the beginning is that the earlier diaries are much, much shorter than the detail-filled ones that we have become used to. They are bare bones and we are not told much about their job or anything that doesn’t have to do with their spending. For those who dislike the detailed diaries this may be appealing, but it does leave a lot of questions unanswered regarding finances (still an issue today).

Another thing to mention is that earlier money diaries contain far less drama and messiness than later diaries do. In fact, most of the drama from early diaries just come from how the commentators view their spending and finances, not actually their behavior or writing style in the diary.

I decided to categorize diaries as interesting, wholesome, or messy.

Interesting – this is due to their profession, situation, or the format (month-long, salary comparison, etc)

Wholesome – these are just a few diaries I found to be nice and relaxing.

Messy – this category is reserved for entries that are dramatic due to the comments, behavior in the diary, or their financial situation. Some standouts include the Alaska diarist who was a part of an mlm and fought with everybody in the comments, the mother in Montana whose husband was on the carnivore diet, and the lovey-dovey DC couple. The level of drama is these diaries range from slightly eyebrow-raising to incredibly side eye-worthy.

Because these categories are very subjective I encourage you all to link to any diaries I missed that you think are interesting.

This was just done for fun and I realize there are going to be entries that people feel don’t fit the categories I put them into (specifically the messy ones), but I just wanted to highlight some old diaries and I wanted to know everyone’s feelings on them.

Link [https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/digital-nomad-traveling-salary-money-diary](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/digital-nomad-traveling-salary-money-diary)","I keep seeing these posts comparing our career trajectories to the diaries that get published. These diaries are published **very** intentionally. R29 is projecting a certain image to their advertisers, and young women with lots of student debt and 5 figure salaries (most people) are less likely to buy a $100 jade roller or whatever. R29 publishes only 10% of the diaries they receive. Their motive is to make money, not to present an accurate picture of most millennial women's finances.

And no, it's not just rich young women who read R29 - the controversial fertility diarist yesterday was definitely working-class. R29 is a company/brand first and foremost, and they want to align themselves with the upper middle class demographic. They want to advertise expensive swimsuits and face creams and fancy workouts.

All of this is to say, please stop comparing yourself to people born on third base who think they hit a triple. R29 makes lots of choices (such as an anonymous and completely unmoderated comment section) to drive traffic to the site that makes them money. 

It's not personal, it's just capitalism. Whoever you are reading this, you are doing fine.","Hi friends! I haven't submitted an MD but I love reading everyone's journeys and have been for a while. I just have a question. All the women I read about seems to have fantastic lifestyle routines and great money investments, cooks like Gordon Ramsay, works out admirably, and just basically has her shit together and all her ducks in a row.

Meanwhile, I'm over here with my boxed meals and fast food; I haven't cooked in a week or two, maybe more; laundry and dishes are piling up; and I barely have the energy to work at my full-time job, much less work out (I've got depression and anxiety - but lez be real - who DOESN'T have depression and anxiety nowadays??). I'm in my early thirties and I feel like I haven't accomplished anything with my life.

Can anyone else here relate, or am I just a kid who still doesn't know how to adult?","  

**Current or most recent job title and your industry**

Regional Airline Captain

 

**Current salary**

For base pay, I make $89/hr and I’m guaranteed a minimum of 72 hours per “bid period” (month-ish). However, I usually (or at least used to) fly at least 80 hours per bid period. So \~$7,120/month base pay pre-tax. We are contractually awarded 11 days off per month, but sometimes my schedule allows for up to 18 days off. Most trips are 4 days long with 2-4 flights per day. Hotels while on trips are paid for. 

Exceeding our minimum guarantee is not considered overtime, but we do have overtime (read: undesirable) trips that we can pick up if the union rest rules allow! Those can pay out up to 3x normal hourly pay. 

About once a year we get a slice of company profit sharing— usually no more than $500 pre-tax. 

Per diem is $1.90/hr. The per-diim clock begins when we check in for our first flight of a trip, and ends when we finish our last flight. This can sometimes span up to 5 days!

\*In breaking down my paychecks for the purpose of this post, I realized I could not find where we are deducted for union dues.... I will investigate further\*

**Deductions**

Paycheck (paid every 2 weeks) deductions: 

$53 pre-tax for Medical/Dental/Vision. 

$4 pre-tax for Loss of FAA Medical Certificate Insurance

7% post-tax for Roth 401(k) contributions. Company matches 50% of that

**Perks**

Oh my, the perks are lovely. First and foremost, a great view! Free domestic & international travel for myself and my fiancé on any flight operated by my carrier. Reduced cost flights on partner airlines or other approved carriers. Some other major discounts on things (hotels, car rentals, cruises, etc) via the company’s employee portal. 

 

**Current location**

I currently live in Dallas, TX. I would consider it MCOL? No state income tax is wonderful, but rent/property tax here is higher than other parts of North Texas. 

&#x200B;

**Age or Years in the workforce**

27 years old and I’ve been with my current employer for a 2.5 years. 

(I was a hostess in high school and a bartender/nanny in college, so I guess technically 10 years in the workforce?)  
 

&#x200B;

**Brief description of your current position**

After 2 years as a First Officer with this airline, I upgraded to Captain! Being Captain comes with different technical and legal responsibilities, in addition to now being the point of leadership for the entire flight crew. I also now sit in the left seat :) 

**Education**

I have a B.A. in Finance from a state school paid for completely by the post-9/11 GI Bill, curtesy of my dad’s 20-year navy service and your tax dollars. 

Flight school was \~$50,000. An inheritance from my late grandfather paid for about half of it, my personal savings paid for another quarter, and I took out a $12,000 loan to cover the rest. In 2016, I paid off the loan using a sign-on bonus.

***How I got here...***

*High school*

My high school boyfriend was a private pilot and would putz around the state in his dad’s old Cessna 172. Although my dad was a fighter pilot my entire childhood, it took a few hearts in my eyes to really get into aviation. The summer before my senior year of high school I earned my private pilot’s license and then casually (a few times/year) flew with that boyfriend and my dad throughout college. 

*December 2014*

I graduated from college and immediately moved home to Houston, TX to work in finance. I hated every second of it. My dad pitched the idea of aviation as a career instead of just a hobby, and I was sold.

*June 2015*

I began an accelerated flight school program that would then, hopefully, lead me to a regional airline placement. I learned to fly in a light twin-engine propeller plane and loved it. I couldn’t imagine working in an office ever again. 

*May 2016*

I graduated flight school and began working as a Certified Flight Instructor until I amassed the 1,500 flight hours required by the FAA to fly for the airlines.

*December 2017*

An official type-rated airline transport pilot! Out of training, I was assigned to Chicago-O’hare. After a few months of commuting to Chicago, I was senior enough to qualify for a transfer to DFW. 

*March 2020* 

Upgraded to Captain!

*Also March 2020*

Applied for and was granted company subsidized leave of absence through June 15 to avoid furlough and still receive 25% of my base pay. My airline received pandemic assistance, so my position is safe for now. We are all holding our breath until October 1st, though. 

 **Salary History**

I honestly do not remember how much I was paid at my first position out of college. Around $70k? Though I do know it was enough for me to save \~$20,000 while living at home before flight school. 

Student pilot in flight school: **$0 -** lived with my parents and survived off of savings and occasionally selling my plasma lol

Flight Instructor: **$18/hour -** the blood, sweat, and tears of the aviation community. This was a tough job and all flight instructors are underpaid and under appreciated imho. I was an independent contractor for the first few months before I signed on with my current airline as a Cadet Flight Instructor. This Cadet-ship gave me a w2 (1099 tax filing was the WORST!), medical/dental insurance, a $12,500 bonus, and 401(k) privileges— in return I signed a 2-year contract. 

First Officer: **$50/hour** \- For the first 5 months at the airline I had to commute to Chicago to sit “on reserve.” This was a highly boring, fairly expensive few months. Along with my place in Texas, I had to rent an apartment in Chicago to just to sit, watch TV, and wait for a phone call… But then I was awarded a transfer to DFW! 

\*Pay scale is all public knowledge and aircraft/position/seniority based— every year at the company you make a little more, when you upgrade to a larger aircraft you make a little more, and when you upgrade to captain you make a lot more!\*

3 Year Captain on the Embraer 175 Regional Jet: **$89/hour**

Advice/Inspiration/Overall: 

Currently, my pilot group is 4.8% female. That means there are 115 of us… Not even enough women to fill a Boeing 737. The majority of my female pilot friends were inspired by their fathers (guilty!), husbands, brothers, etc, or were former flight attendants who ached for the cockpit. I believe that every woman is capable of flight, they just need the exposure and the encouragement. I wrote a Money Diary almost two years ago hoping that it would normalize a position so often dismissed as a boys-only job, and I hope this might do the same! 

I didn’t have any civilian mentors while in flight school, so I turned to social media to seek out successful female airline pilots. This was extraordinarily helpful at seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. Lots of great, down to earth women on Facebook and Instagram! (the r/flying thread is almost all dudes. lol classic) If you have any questions, I’m happy to answer!","Sorry for the humble brag, but this one feels really, really good. It won’t last long because I have some bills coming out, but it won’t be long until it stays over.

This was all after:

-losing a job and going through my emergency fund
-starting my own business which didn’t work out and took more of my investments
-getting a new job where I was surrounded by people spending $$ like crazy and falling into some bad habit, which wiped out the rest of my investments
-selling my house for a lot less than I paid for it (which was insane as I bought it after the market crash in 2008). I barely got my down payment back even after 10 years of equity build up.

I’ve spent the last few years really focusing on my career development, which is now paying off in spades. Now I’ve just been focusing on keeping my expenses down while not trying to get too bogged down in frugality. 

Thanks for listening!!!","This is MY unpopular ""OPINION"". 

I see so many comments about how ""this doesn't relate to me"" or ""how can I learn money saving tips when I can't relate"". Google ""how to save money"" and you'll get 100000 articles. But how many platforms are out there sharing their nitty gritty guilty seamless orders? I never thought of Money Diaries as a resource how I can manage my money, and I don't think that was R29's initial intentions. Has it changed my perspective? Definitely. Have I learned some things along the way? Ehh. But have I been entertained? HECK YES. 

Piggybacking on the previous post about thanking all the OPs who have posted money diaries, thank you for opening our eyes to the diversity in ALL situations. Low money diaries, middle money diaries, high money diaries. I love you all!","Does anyone else feel incredibly sad/depressed about returning to work after a long weekend?

I'm trying to assess if this is a normal feeling, or if my job is not a good fit for me.

Just had a 3-day weekend for Memorial Day. I felt so free and happy bc I could spend my time as I wish. Returning to work today feels like going to prison since I have to spend my time worrying about stressful minutae that I just really don't care about. It's discouraging to waste all my mental energy and time on work tasks.","A few weeks ago I posted here, asking what you would buy with $500. The stipulations were that it had to be fun purchases - no donations, dinners, bills, etc. My husband and I sold our house and paid down debt, made donations, and did responsible things with the profit. We decided to each take $500 and have fun with it. We’re responsible and we’ve budgeted well (I work and he’s in law school) so this was intended to be a fun thing. You guys had fantastic recommendations and I loved looking up your items. 

I wanted to update with what I bought. 

1. Tory Burch Miller Metal Crossbody. On sale at Zappos for $211. 
2. Reformation Kaila dress in black. On sale for $78. 
3. 3 outfits from Majorelle on Revolve’s website. They totaled $107. 
4. A lululemon sweater from a Facebook resale group. $15. 
5. A pair of New Balance New York Marathon rubbing capris from Poshmark for $21. I’m running it this year (fingers crossed it goes on.)

And that’s it, so far. 

My husband has spent a grand total of $0. Sigh.",Considering r29 won't be posting a money diary tomorrow I thought it might be fun to post a roundup of some older noteworthy (starting from the very first money diary up to the creation of this sub) money diaries that those who started reading money diaries a little later might not have read. Would that interest you guys or have most of you read the majority of diaries r29 has posted?,"My tax refund was deposited into my bank account this morning and I used part of it to pay off the last $1800 of my student loan! I am so happy right now!

I graduated in 2013 with \~$25000 in student loans. When I started making payments I was only paying the minimum (10-year repayment), but in the last two years, I have thrown all my extra money at them. In October I was offered a line of credit with prime+1 interest and used that to pay off my actual loan, which has also helped. 

I'm going to treat my partner and me to a very fancy dinner and then buy myself a laser hair removal package before putting those payments back into savings!","Assets and Debts 

Checking Account: $6,281.80 

Savings Account: I have a CD savings account with my bank that has $4,000 in it. 
I also have a safe with cash in it in my apartment that has $10,000 in it. I like to pay for things in cash 💵 (i.e nails, lashes, hair, going out to eat, drinks 🍷, and even rent!) I keep all of my cash in separate envelopes with the date, amount and exactly what it’s to be used  for written on it, so I stay within somewhat of a budget. 
Example - July - Nails 💅🏻- $50 

Retirement Savings - $0 I cashed out my 401k a year ago when I quit my job (dumb I know but there wasn’t much money in it anyways) and haven’t started another retirement fund yet. 

Credit Card Debt - $0 I have 3 credit cards and pay them off immediately each month (I actually just paid the bills yesterday). I worked really hard to have good credit to fall back on.

Medical/Dental Debt- $0 in Medical debt and $410 a month in Dental debt. 
I had really bad teeth so I had to take out a care credit loan to fix them (Invisalign,veneers, whitening etc.) (it cost me over $15,000). Ive made a few big payments but still have some left to go.

Student Loan Debt- $0 from undergrad thanks to financial aid and a generous grandma.
Currently I’m part-time paying $250 a credit and currently taking 6 credits. This is a program that will hopefully help me get into a graduate program after I finish (my undergrad grades were really bad).


Income: paid 2x a month $1100 and 1x a month $5000 - I make $7200 a month total.

Monthly Expenses:

Rent - I pay $1400 a month for a decently sized one bedroom apartment in a not so great area of Queens. I’m very grateful my landlord has not raised my rent for the few years I’ve lived here.

Utilities- $70 for internet and around $50-100 a month for electric. My landlord pays gas/heat and water.

Healthcare - $650 for medical/dental/vision. I had excellent health coverage 100% through my old employer and remained on COBRA once I left. 

Transportation - I pay $127 a month for a monthly unlimited subway pass. I also average about $300-500 a month on cabs and Ubers (trying to cut back).

Cell phone - $139.28 - Unlimited plus I’m still paying off my phone upgrade.

Gym - $20 for a PF membership I never use. I occasionally buy fitness classes too (about $30 each) I would say I spent about $60 a month additionally on fitness classes.

Tanning Membership - $89 (I know it’s bad but I just love tanning in the winter months ☀️)

Netflix - $8.99
Apple Music - $8.99
Uber Eats Premium Member - $5.99
Amazon Prime - $14.99


Day 1 
Sunday 

I wake up at 11:10am to the sound of my phone ringing. My best friend from home is calling. Lately I’ve been spending a lot of time alone this jolts me awake. We talk on the phone for about 2 hours. During this time I walk to a coffee shop and get a large coffee ($3.50), get ready for the day and clean up my apartment. 
I make myself a to-do list which includes ordering some household items from Amazon. I login and order a new rug ($48), a salad chopper ($15) a new salad bowl ($6) and a cheese grater ($7). 
I start to get hungry but I’ve been trying to cut back on food spending, I find an apple in the fridge and make myself a tuna salad using some canned tuna and an onion I had in the fridge also ($0).
I go downstairs to check the mail and see I have a free tanning lotion packet coupon. I decide to use and walk a couple miles to the tanning salon, because I already pay a membership fee the session didn’t cost me anything.
I get home and text my SD and play on my phone until it’s time for dinner. I have some leftover past in the fridge so I eat that ($0) I watch Netflix until I fall asleep.

Daily Total - $79.50

Day 2 
Monday

Today is an errand day. The best part of not working during the week is being able to do errands while nobody else is out, completely unbothered. 
I strip my bed and gather my dirty laundry. I walk to the laundromat and feel pretty accomplished after doing 3 loads of laundry, including sheets and towels. I ran out of money on my laundry card so I use a $20 bill to put on there. Even though I wash and fold my laundry myself I still put $2 in the tip jar on the way out, the woman who works there is always really nice to me. (Total- $22)
After I put away my laundry and make my bed I walk to the same coffee shop. I get a coffee ($3.50) and a salad ($11). Next I walk to the nail salon.
The nail salon always gives me a cash discount. Today I’m getting a full new set. ($48) plus I tip ($7). 
The grocery store is right next store. I want to make lasagna tonight but with layers of zucchini instead of noodles (idk I saw it on a food account). I buy ground beef, ricotta, garlic, canned tomatoes, olive oil, and zucchini. (Total - $25.56).
After dinner I complete a homework assignment, watch Netflix and text my SD until I fall asleep.

Daily Total - $116.50

Day 3
Tuesday 

Today is not a good day.
Last night I was woken up by a noise in my closet and there was a mouse in my apartment! 
I make a coffee at home and immediately head out to the store to buy mouse traps. ($12) and some peanut butter ($2) I feel bad for the creature but I am not looking for a roommate.
After I set them up my dad calls to tell me my grandma had sent me a card a couple days ago and is currently in the hospital. Things aren’t looking good for her unfortunately.
I go to check the mail and see the card along with a medical bill.
I open the card and it says she misses me along with a $20 bill inside (+$20). The bill was from a lab that wasn’t covered by my insurance when I had a vitamin deficiency check. It’s $62.80, I just write the check and mail it out because I don’t feel like dealing with health insurance customer service today. ($62.80).
I try to eat the leftover lasagna for dinner but it doesn’t taste very good. I end up taking the subway ($0 because prepaid subway card) into the city for dinner.
I go to a bar where I know the bartender. I get a petite steak with potatoes ($39) and a glass of sangria ($10) he ends up giving me 2 free glasses of wine while we chat also! I also tip at the end ($15)
My friend just got a new apartment in a luxury building and wants me to come check it out. I order a cheese plate to go ($20). Then I order a cab ($13 plus $3 tip -$16) and head over. 
She recorded 90 day fiancé so we watch that and some other trash TV and chat over a bottle of wine she had while we split the cheese plate. I order an Uber home ($36).

Daily total - $192.80

Day 4
Wednesday 

I wake up with head pounding from the wine so I make some coffee and have some Advil. I lay in bed for a couple hours watching Netflix until it subsides.
After I get up i eat a little of the leftover lasagna thing. Then I go to a local coffee shop, order a coffee ($3.50) and work on a class project and finish up some homework before school.
I take the subway to my night class and after class pick up a prescription ($1 copay). While picking up the prescription I buy a dark chocolate bar at the pharmacy ($3). 
I also manage to get to Sephora right before they close to buy a new foundation I need ($40). 
I get on the subway and while on my phone on the way home I make a sale on my online clothing reseller account(+$44). When I get home I print the shipping label and package it up to send out in the morning.
I end up eating the chocolate bar for dinner. 

Daily Total - $3.50

Day 5
Thursday 

My dad calls to give me an update on my grandma, she is slowly doing getting better. This reminds me to send her a thank you card. 
I have one lying around in my drawer. I put a postage stamp (10 cents) on it and mail it out with the package. I also grab a coffee at the Dunkin across the street from the post office (free because I had a gift card).
While I’m in the shower I notice I’m out of hair conditioner. I get out, get dressed go buy some at the nearby store ($12.06) and then come back and wash my hair. 
I don’t feel like making food so I Uber Eats a salad ($13.66) for lunch. 
I organize and clean my apartment (I’m kind of a neat freak) until it’s time to take the subway to my 6pm night class. It takes me an hour during rush hour so I have to leave just before 5pm to be on time. Today I left at 4:30pm so I could ask my professor some questions about an assignment before class.
After class ends my SD (SD number 1) texts me and tells me to come meet him for a drink. I take a cab ($18 with tip) over. I have 2 margaritas on him and end up spending the night at his place. 
I can’t fall asleep and just want to go home to my own bed. I don’t even care that there is an uncaught mouse potentially still roaming around.  

Daily total - $43.72

Day 6
Friday

In the morning SD 1 gives me my biweekly 1100 allowance. We met back when I was bartender at a strip club and he has no clue about SD 2. Luckily, he has to get up bright and early for work. I order an Uber at about 7am. Because of rush hour/high demand it costs me ($47.40) to get home. 
I am so tired but also so hungry. I Uber Eats some shrimp tacos, ($22.50) eat them, and then fall asleep until the late afternoon. When I wake it’s getting dark already and I barely saw any sun at all today. I wake up feeling groggy and sad. 
I take a shower but don’t feel like washing and blow drying my hair. I walk to a nearby salon and get a blowout ($30 plus $5 tip - $35). 
I make some coffee and then some tea while I do my make up and get ready to head out. Tonight I’m seeing SD 2. 
I walk to the liquor store and buy a bottle of wine for us ($20). Then I take the subway to his place in Manhattan. I lie and tell him I took a cab (he thinks the subway is disgusting) but I feel like I would get car sick in a car right now.
I like SD 2 much better than SD 1. He’s younger - closer to my age, and I can actually relate to him. We talk about our favorite Netflix shows and I make sure to show interest and ask him a lot of questions about work. 
We go to the bedroom and afterwards he orders me a cab home. He already had given me my monthly allowance (5000) earlier in the month.
I’m still feeling a little sad so I immediately go to bed as soon as I get home. 

Daily total - $125.00

Day 7
Saturday 

I wake up at 8:10am and don’t feel like getting out of bed at all. I Uber eats a Starbucks coffee and iced tea -($14.72 cause of fees and tip).
My friend from earlier in the week calls me. She needs me to help her edit some work letters (grammar isn’t her forte and I minored in writing/do some freelance editing work). She says for my help she’ll pay me $100. 
I make myself another coffee and spent the next 4 hours working on her papers. I email them out and she Venmo’s me the $ (+$100). 
I’m hungry and don’t know what to eat. I find a box of whole wheat pasta in my pantry, I still have some leftover zucchini, garlic and half an onion in my fridge. I fry that up in a little olive and mix it into the pasta with some seasonings.
After I finish washing the dishes I think about how good some fresh basil would be to cook with. 
I walk to the plant store (?) and buy a basil plant ($12) and a small houseplant ($17) maybe this will make me feel less sad? 
It’s so cold out this time of year that even the short walk to the store makes me not want to go outside again. I stay in the rest of the night alone and watch some of my favorite YouTubers. While doing so I decide that exercise might help me feel better and purchase 2 fitness classes online ($60). 
Having the pass purchased and the class scheduled makes me sure ill go unlike when I tell myself I’m going to go to the gym. 

Daily Total - $3.72


Weekly Total - $564.74","I’m the dispatcher from the prairies (a Canadian Money Diary.) I don’t really know how to prove it save posting the emails I got from the editor. 

I wrote a very thorough, extensive money diary that focused on my career and my mental health. At the time R29 contacted me, it was nearly a year old. They told me they were editing it to protect my identity and that of the agency I work with, but ended up editing it to the point I got the comments I did - about my inability to do this job I had then been in for a year. 

Before I start, I’m still not identifying the agency BUT every aspect of the hiring process is publicly available information, so no, they didn’t have to edit this out. 

I was in the hiring process for two years before I stepped foot in the classroom. Yup, two years. A year of that was my security clearance, but the year before was:

1) the Criticall 
2) the interview 
3) the medical evaluation
4) the psychological evaluation 

Yep - I went through a psych evaluation. I took the MMPI-2 and met with the agency’s psychiatrist and psychometrist. They cleared me. I also got cleared by my own therapist. She, in fact, was delighted I was choosing this career. All of this was taken out by R29. 

Next, they edited out a bunch of the mundane calls I took and my field coaching info. Fine, no one wants to read about car crashes and house break-ins. But what really made me upset is that Refinery 29 edited my trigger call. 

I speak a secondary language, and that call ended up being routed to me and my coach as it’s in that language. Three years previously I had pressed (and dropped) charges against my father for breaking my thumb when he hit me and my dog with a broom and I tried to call 911. When this call happened, I went into professional mode and handled it. I was ready for the next one after. It was my coach who sent me off to take a breather. 

When I came back in my coach told me they were incredibly impressed. My fears of these situations were expressed in my training. We were working through it. We reached out to the officers and learned that the way I handled the call worked well for them and everyone involved was unharmed and safe. I ended up testifying about it later (the call couldn’t just be played as it was in another language.) 

The overwhelming emotion of being the person I needed is what made me cry for the rest of the day, not because it was a triggering call, but because I did right by them. 

None of this was even mentioned or hinted at. All the salacious bits - a scary Amber Alert, my crying - was left in to garner clicks, comments, and drama. I’ve been on the internet for a long time and gotten into my fair share of fights but reading strangers’ judgements on a profession they have absolutely NO insight into was... unfair. It was unfair because they didn’t have all the details. Not their fault. But I implore you to remember the humans behind these diaries. And I want you to know that yes, they’re edited for drama. 

In fact, it was other emergency personnel who treated me kindly in the comments. 

I’m a second-tier operator now. I see veteran operators cry, too. And they’re the best operators I work with. By the way, I don’t intend to sound all preachy and finger wagging. I recognize my emotions got the best of me. I lived in an abusive home for 21 years. I did extensive trauma therapy - once a week for 18 months, bless benefits - and still have lots to unlearn about the way I grew up. But I’m really happy in my career and being a point of safety because I know what it’s like not having one. And I’ll never apologize for having empathy. 

I still enjoy reading Money Diaries and I can write an updated one for here :)","Made a throwaway for this because some of the folks posting here are so hateful and I don't want them to doxx me.

The SF diarist's drama watch thread is awful - the comments were worse than the ones you see on R29. Even there, doxxing isn't tolerated, so why is it okay here? It's awful to go on that lady's insta page and pick apart her and her husband's life. I saw hateful comments about her style, her tattoos (wtf!), her job etc. 

This sub has nearly 10k subscribers and I think we should have some rules, enforced by moderator warning and bans.","I looked up the statistics, and in 2016, only 46% of employed women aged 25 to 29 had a college degree. Yet, I think something like 99% of diaries are from college educated women. Just an observation. If you’re a non college educated woman on the this sub, I’d love to hear about your career path in the comments!","I've been reading a lot of Money Diaries lately, and I swear this morning I tuned in to my internal monologue and found myself thinking, ""I grab a Raspberry White Chocolate QuestBar and a banana and pour my leftover coffee into a to-go cup. I kiss my sleeping boyfriend goodbye and I'm out the door! Check my bank account once I get to work and see the stimulus check has deposited for me. Score! **(+$1200)**""","This isn’t a money diary because it doesn’t have amounts, but it is a diary of a woman working two part time jobs in Durham, NC. Not my story, but I wanted to share since it’s a perspective I don’t often see on money diaries.

https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/zmjjnj/how-i-get-by-a-week-in-the-life-of-a-mcdonalds-cashier?fbclid=IwAR09ESqEcR4rekPcn73qvYM3BA_v5pmZdY2sdMhwTuAvQe8rb9MA5lOzAKs","Since there's another thread with a poll of how much people on the sub make, I decided to make a comparable chart of incomes on R29's Money Diaries.

[Here's the spreadsheet I put together.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_3PzUe7ggUPL1JMuA_kITjjBs88wwt4mEP6WOmBwxrQ/edit?usp=sharing) It includes 271 diaries, starting from the most recent, with some excluded as noted below.

I took the income amount and whether it was joint or not directly from the title, unless the title gave an hourly wage.  
For hourly, I assumed 40 hours/week unless the diary intro indicated I shouldn't.  
If I couldn't estimate the person's total income (for example, several who had multiple hourly jobs but just gave hourly rates, no estimates of hours worked or total earned), I excluded them.

Sheet 1 is comparable to the poll here on the sub. For Sheet 2, I separated single and joint incomes, since I saw some comments on the poll asking for that. Then I tried doubling the brackets for the joint incomes...","Hey everyone, I thought I would make a post about benefits since I’ve seen those without a job right now and you may be trying to figure out what steps to take. 

If you’ve lost your job and are living off of savings or just living paycheck to paycheck, then apply for snap benefits (food stamps). Even if you’re a household of 1 you’ll qualify for at minimum 3 months at the max benefit amount according to your state. And because of Covid-19 they are also extending relief without work search. You can also download an app called FreshEbt to keep track of the funds on your account. They are also randomly selecting accounts to donate and extra $1000 to certain participants within certain states (I’m fuzzy on the details of this honestly). 

Check your snap benefits site to see if they participate in the “double up food bucks” program as well. This program is setup in certain stores to stretch the amount of money being spent of fruits and veggies and for each dollar spent on them you’ll get another dollar of veggies/fruits free. 

Please also apply for state health insurance, if you’ve lost that as well. I applied for both health insurance and snap on March 20th and received my card within a weeks time.

If you already have snap/wic benefits or Medicare and use prime, contact them to switch your account over to a reduced fee account. Instead of paying $14, you’ll pay 6, this reduced price will last for 1 year after initial sign up before you have to requalify. 

If you also need any other assistance, call 211 (doesn’t matter the state of residence) and they can help lead you in more directions. 

I just hope this helps alleviate some burden for someone. Especially given the state of unemployment offices right now. It’s a lot easier on snap/wic/medicare offices to push applications through as of right now and get people funded in whatever way possible.","Hi all I wrote a diary about my work as a Certified Nursing Assistant in NYC. **Please be careful this diary contains some mention of death so if that is a trigger for you pls don't read it.** Just a peek at how we are fighting the pandemic.

**Sunday 4/5**   
**1:30 am I go to the vending machine for some diet coke, I never drink soda when I am home but once I am at work I drink at least a bottle/shift. ($1.60).**   
**2:45 am On my break and decided to surprise my little sister and pay for unlimited data on her phone. She complained about being bored with the stay at home order. And she can’t do much online because she can only afford very little data. ($40)**  
**8:05 am Home, ate some cornmeal porridge and light out.**  
**3:05 pm Am back at work. Sadly we are working short.  This pandemic is hitting us where it really hurts. Some of my coworkers have gotten sick, others are truly too scared to work more than their regular shifts.**    
**I personally, won’t judge anybody’s choice. For me, I promise myself to do the best I can, to help us survive this pandemic.**    
**7:30 pm A coworker treated me to Nigerian Jollof rice with mixed vegetables from an African Restaurant nearby(it was delivered). I got a soda from the vending machine for both of us. ($3.20)**  
**11:00 pm This shift ends and another one starts, am working a double shift**  
**Total: $44.80**  
**Monday  4/6**   
**12:05 am: We have had residents die of coronavirus and some on IVs and oxygen because of coronavirus. It is scary to know that I might get it if I continue to work on my floor, but I also know I can’t leave my residents.**   
**2:00 am I am in the bathroom crying two of my coworkers are sick(coronavirus), one has severe pneumonia and the other is on a vent in the hospital. I am having a very hard time understanding how he became so sick. He looked really healthy. He and I have always teased each other, God I hope he pulls through.**   
**7:05 am Am done for today.**   
**9:15 am I am still in the locker room at work because my friend doesn’t get home until 2 pm today. I got a call from the staffing coordinator if I could help them back on the floor; only 2 out of 4 CNA showed up.  At first, I said no because I have just worked 16 hours. Finally, I give in on the condition I get to leave before 3 pm. I know for her to call me that means she must have called everybody and no dice. Also, there is no way 2 people can honestly take care of about 40 residents.**   
**1:30 pm Finally, I am out so in total I did about 20 hours.**   
**5:00 pm Shower and nite nite**  
**Total: $1.60**  
**Tuesday 4/7**  
**5:30 am Am up. Oh, sh\*t!! I  slept for 12 hours straight. I turn the T.V. on for background noise and start coding. I am taking a pause on my bachelor's education.  To be honest, I don’t think I will be going back to get my bachelors anytime soon, I truly can’t afford it.  I have been teaching myself how to code using a lot of materials  I find online. One thing I saw on Youtube is that it is easier to learn how to code if it is project-driven. So as per youtube, I am building a program of the tic tac toe game.**  
**8:30 am I made some scrambled eggs for me and my friend.  After which I hang out a bit with my friend then back to coding.**   
**11:00 am Head to laundry the first two I went to are closed. The third only do drop off and not the same day or next day delivery. Then I  take the subway two stops, to the fourth one: this one is open but there is a line because of social distance and the laundromat is backed up with their dry cleaning service so half the washer and dryer isn’t available.  God am fucked! I gotta work this afternoon.  After begging the owner and showing her that my dirty laundry is mostly scrubs, she let me jump the line. Thank God for small blesses!($8.50)**  
**3:05 pm I am back to work. I found out, two of my residents passed away, one in the hospital and the other in the nursing home. I don’t even cry anymore, I just let it sink in.  Again there are only two of us instead of three CNAs, what are you gonna do?**   
**10:30 pm Finally, I was done with this shift and just realized I haven’t eaten since breakfast.  My job does provide us with food in accordance with the union contract. Today’s Tri-color rasta pasta with curry chicken. I went for a second, damn I was hungry.**   
**Total $8.50**  
**Wednesday 4/8**  
**12.05 am  Yep, you guessed it I am still at work. So far things have been so quiet.  Of course, we don’t say the Q(quiet) word aloud. Many of us believe,  once you say it, things start to go wrong. Residents falling out of beds, code blues, call bells going crazy and all. So we say “Wow it is such a good night” instead.**  
**8:30 am Home and shower. I am hungry but also, I am very sleepy so I chose to sleep.**  
**3:00 pm Up my friend and I decided to make Moi-Moi. Which entails my friend doing all the cooking and me keeping her company and working on my code, I am having a syntax error.**    
**6:00 pm Once we have eaten I take a break and play scrabble, which my friend easily won.  I suck at spelling. I don’t know why. I like to read, one can say a word and I know the meaning but I can’t spell it correctly to save my life.**    
9:30 pm **Back to my code and light out  3 hours later.**   
**Total: $0**  
**Thursday 4/9**  
**7:30 am Wake up to my worst nightmare, there is a giant crack on my laptop screen. WTF!!!! I fell asleep with my laptop on my chest. After my friend calmed me down she left for work.  I started making calls to repair centers until I found one in the city that does same day repair but I have $45 extra to the quote.**   
**10:00 am So my laptop will cost $399 + $45 + tax. On my way back I called my mom. I have been lying to my mom about how bad the coronavirus is at my work. I guess she found out from my sister, who lives in the Midwest. Growing up, I was a very sickly child always in the hospital. Twice I received the anointing of the sick from my parish priest but luckily somehow I pulled through both times. So I understand why my mom is crying. I promise her that I will be very careful. I'm planning on going to see my mother this summer before she goes back to my home country. This will be the first time I will be seeing her in 9 years. A certain part of me feels like a failure for not having a professional job to show for all my time in America. Hopefully, I will learn enough to get an internship this year.**   
**4 pm Pick up my laptop it cost me a total of $480. Lesson learned don’t fall asleep with your laptop on your chest.  I started coding again and I was able to fix my syntax error, this made me very proud of myself.**   
**11:00 pm Back at work I heard that my coworker on the vent passed away, so did another resident last night. I have lost so many people in the space of 6 six weeks it is hard to cry.  This is one part of this job I hate. You meet the resident and love them, how can you not love them. Logically, I know they may not go home but it still hurts when they die. Now my friend is dead too.**   
**Total: $480**  
**Friday 4/10**  
**12:05 am  Head to the vending machine for diet coke. The air at work is that of mourning. God, I miss my friend. ($1.60)**  
**8:30 am Home and call my best friend and she tries to cheer me up but it is not working. I feel awful bothering her with this. Shower and head to bed.**    
**4:30 pm  We planned on making pepper soup today for dinner but I just wasn't in the mood to cook. So we ordered from a Thai restaurant nearby. The food was very good. ($25)**   
7:30 pm **I put my feelings aside so as not to dampen everything for my friend.  We went for a walk with our face mask on.**   
**11:00 pm Back at work to start my regular shift. Hoping for a good night.**  
**Total: $26.60**  
**Saturday 4/11**  
**2:00 am We lost another resident. Fuck coronavirus. God can this end already, am sick and tired of all this. My mind is getting numb.**   
**I help wrap my resident I say a silent prayer. Sometime later I got some soda. ($1.60)**  
**8:30 am My wonderful friend made some saltfish fritters. I love her. I am so grateful that not only did she take me in but she feeds me too for only $500 / month. She is the best. I ate,  shower and go to bed.**  
**3:05 pm  I am at work.  Coworkers and I decided to play the power ball game. And just like any power ball dreamer, we are already planning what we will spend the money on if we win. And to make it more interesting I decided to write a few lines of code that will pick the numbers for us randomly. ($10.00)**  
**7:30 pm My coworker brought Jamaica Escovitch fish for everybody on my floor. And it is very tasty. I get a soda for my dinner. ($1.60)**  
11:20 pm **We won all of $2. Now we know next time we will do a human pick instead.**   
**Total: $13.20**  
**Weekly Total:$574.70**   
**Reflection**  
**I am sorry if this is depressing for anyone. I just wanted to show what is really happening in the fight against coronavirus. Of course, this is my personal experience and doesn’t represent everyone in the front line. This week is a lot higher than it usually is as I don’t fix my laptop every week.  I wrote this diary for many reasons first to showcase people like me who are trying to make it work in NYC. Although I don’t currently live in NYC, I have lived in NYC on a lower salary, and I will be moving back by June of this year while still on this salary.**   
**Another reason why I wrote this diary is to show how hard it can be to move up from a lower class, and I have it much much easier than most people do.  Thanks again for reading my week journey.**","**Part One: Assets and Debts:**

* **Retirement Accounts.**
   * 401(k): $145,173: Since law school graduation, I have maxed my 401(k) each year I have been eligible.
      * I contribute 10% of my salary to my 401(k) and receive a 7.5% match. I did not receive a match at my prior jobs.
      * Together with my employer's contribution, I contribute an average of \~$2,900/month to my 401(k).
   * Roth IRA/401(k): $12,546.78: I started taking advantage of Back-Door Roth and Mega Back-Door Roth last year.
* **Taxable Investment Accounts:** $27,683.11 (This is a priority now that I have repaid my debt, bought a home and fully funded my emergency savings).
* **Cash.**
   * High Yield Savings/Checking Account: $61,414.56. This includes the below, plus interested earned:
      * $39,840.00 in ""Banana Stand"" Money (8 Month Emergency Fund, Home Repairs Savings, Car Insurance Deductible, Healthcare ""Out of Pocket Maximum"" etc.)
      * $20,000 for Long*ish*\-Term Goals. Since the horizon on these goals is <5 yrs, I am uncomfortable investing this.
   * Daily Use Checking Account: \~$4,500
* **Equity (if Homeowner)**: $55,000. I put down 5% or \~$20,000 (using the cash I had saved up)  and made some aggressive payments when I bought in August 2018; Condo is valued at $415,000.
* **Student Loans**: $0. I paid off my remaining loans \~$108,000 in 2017 (four years after graduation). (I also had a full-tuition scholarship to law school and 80% scholarship to undergrad. New York's cost of living required me to take out loans to cover living expenses and the delta between tuition and my scholarship required some loans for undergrad.)
* **Other debt**: None. My car is paid off and I don't carry a balance on my credit cards.
* **Other Information:** I'm a foster parent (of children). However, many of those expenses are reimbursable (or come out of the per diem the state provides) and I am not currently fostering any small humans. I set aside money monthly for fun stuff to do with the kiddos even when I'm not fostering.

**Part Two: Income**

* **Primary Income**: My take-home amount increased to **$9,580** after I hit the FICA-SS cap in July. It's usually **\~$8,690 monthly** (after pre-tax deductions, taxes and retirement contributions). Both figures are based on months where I get paid twice, but since I'm paid bi-weekly, there are months where I'm paid \~$12,000.
   * **Bonus.** My cash bonus is \~20% of my salary. I also receive a stock grant each year.
* **Secondary Income: \~$500-$2,000.** This varies wildly from month to month so I did not include this income in the salary and don't include it in my goal planning. I co-own a side hustle with a friend; presently stretching my legs and evaluating if I can manage this business on my own as she is relocating to a new state in the fall.

**Part Three: Expenses**

***Monthly Expenses***

* **Pre-Tax**: Retirement (Average \~$1,846), Health ($74.28); Dental ($7.32) and Vision ($7.16)
* **Mortgage**: $1,871.00 for a 2BD condo downtown
* **Self-Managed Escrow**: $518.00 (Includes property taxes, insurance, and HOA).
* **Electric/Gas/Internet:** $177.90 (I use budget billing so this figure stays the same).
* **Phone/Cell Service/Gym:** $0 (Covered by work)
* **Savings:** Determined by Annual Goals (Limited Examples Below for Brevity)
   * $500/month to 2020 Roth IRA (Backdoor)
   * $1000/month (plus leftovers) to Investment Account
   * $200/month to Adoption Fund (I would like to adopt in four years)
   * $75-$100/month to 2019 Christmas sinking fund
   * $300/month into a Home Repair Fund (Save 3% of Purchase Price per year)
* **Car Insurance:** $93.00/month
* **Subscriptions:** $37.21 - I cover the cost of Netflix, Hulu and Apple Music for myself and my siblings.
* **Life Insurance**: $30.53 for my large term policy (siblings and niece are beneficiaries)
* **Other (Data from YNAB)**: Groceries (Average $149/month); Gas (Average $92/month); 529 Niece (Auto-contribute $100/month); Dining Out (Average $57/month); Dinner with Friends (Budget $100/month)

***Annual Expenses***

* **Amazon Prime:** $119.00
* **Costco:** $60.00
* **YNAB (You Need a Budget):** $75.00
* **Charitable Contributions:** I donate my time as well as 5% of my prior year's income to foster care-related organizations since my siblings and I grew up in the foster care system.

\-------------------------------------------

**Day One (Tuesday):**

***03:00 am***: I wake up exhausted; I returned to the U.S. from an eight-day vacation in Europe on Saturday and still haven't re-adjusted to central time. I have never been more grateful to hear my coffee machine loudly grinding beans. I contemplate taking a five-minute ""nap"" while it brews but the idea of drinking lukewarm coffee outweighs my jet-lag and I get out of bed.

In between sips of coffee, I wash the dishes that I allowed to pile up between my recent travels and contemplate hiring a monthly cleaning service. I put in a pin in that thought and grab a shower before hurrying through my morning routine (pull on the clothes I set out yesterday, brush my teeth and run through my skincare routine (double cleanse, toner, essence, serum, moisturizer and liquid caffeine for my horrible undereye dark circles). I finish the routine by digging my sunscreen and mascara out of my still full suitcase and swiping on some tinted chapstick.

***04:00 am***: I'm headed to another one of our offices this morning (about three and a half hours away) to provide some legal training so I dump the stuff from my vacation onto the floor and pack for my trip. To avoid traffic in Chicago, I grab my suitcase, my purse, and my backpack and I'm in my car by 4:45 am. I turn on some jams and start my long drive.

***05:30 am***: Stop for gas ($34.38; expensed), set my navigation toward our office and get back on the road. I make good time and get to Starbucks at 7:45 am. I dive into my presentation over a caramel macchiato with almond milk ($5.74; expensed) and scribble notes throughout the deck and then sit in my car and rehearse the presentation twice.

***10:00 am:*** Check my work email and forward a couple of time-sensitive inquiries to outside counsel. Call one of our businesses about a regulatory issue and roll my eyes throughout the call as my contact mansplains the law to me. I correct a couple of misstatements he makes for the benefit of the team before promising to have someone get back to him later this week with a solution. I delegate the matter to outside counsel to preserve my (arguable) sanity.

***11:30 am:***  I make a final pass through the presentation and meet my co-presenter (my boss) for lunch at Chipotle. ($11.50; expensed). We run through our talking points and I incorporate some last-minute changes she proposes. She's also a friend so I catch up her up on a few things in my personal life as well as some urgent work issues that I'd like her input on.

***1:00 pm***: Presentation time! We get so many questions we only make it 1/3 of the way through our materials. This is actually good news because it means that folks are engaged with our content and not falling asleep. We answer as many questions as time permits and promise to come back and do more training soon.

***3:30 pm***: My boss heads back to the city and I head to my hotel: I am staying through tomorrow to attend training with a third party vendor. I check into my hotel and immediately climb into bed with my laptop to churn through a couple of contracts. Start a draft of a new agreement I meant to send out this morning. *oops.*

***4:45 pm***: Head to the hotel lobby for a networking outing. I'm so tired and should have begged off but a huge part of being in-house is getting to know your business colleagues and getting them to trust that you are not a barrier to success but a partner. The event ends up being vodka-soaked and super fun and we close the evening by grabbing ice-cream (expensed on someone else's card) at a local spot.

***11:00 pm***: I revisit and finish the now overdue contract and send it out. I also respond to a couple of other inquiries, do my skincare routine (same as morning minus the sunscreen and mascara) and set an alarm before turning in at 12:45.

**Daily Total $0**

&#x200B;

**Day Two (Wednesday)**

***01:45 am***: My hotel room has adjoining doors and someone is watching tv loudly next door or talking loudly in the hallway - *I'm too tired to find out which.* I turn on a sound machine app on my phone, dig some earplugs out of my overnight bag and go back to sleep.

***04:00 am***: I toss and turn for a bit and then give up on sleep, cancel my alarm and read trashy news. Eventually, I open up You Need a Budget (YNAB) and do some budget gardening (e.g. add in a couple of expenses, approve/modify some automatically imported ones, review budget overall, etc.). I also take a peek at some of the emails I missed yesterday and write responses to any that require only a minimal level of thought.

***06:00 am***: I do a yoga video, take a quick shower, twist my hair up into a side-braid situation and do my skincare routine. Like yesterday, I put on some mascara, sunscreen, and tinted chap-stick. While I'm thinking of it, I text my hairdresser to ask if she has any openings to do box braids. This summer humidity is playing real games with my hair. She immediately texts me back to let me know that I am SOL. *Oh well!* I head out to the office at 7:30 and nosh from a fruit platter once I get there.

***8:00 am***: I juggle vendor training and conference calls until 10:00 am when I am able to give the training my full attention. I jot down notes for my boss throughout. We break for lunch (free but very sad looking salad!) and then pick back up for the afternoon.

***4:00 pm***: Training is over! I top up my gas tank and grab a cold brew coffee at the gas station to keep me awake for the drive. ($19.86; expensed). During the drive, I call my younger sister, J, to catch up about my trip to Paris, my dating life and her ongoing campaign to mock me relentlessly. We chat for an hour and it feels like ten minutes; she's the best.

***8:00 pm:*** Home! I turn on my air conditioning, sort through my mail and snack on some beets and feta cheese while I review a couple of contracts. On my sister's texted recommendation, I take a break to read the money diary about the [32-year-old who is cheating on her boyfriend](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/chicago-il-finance-manager-salary-money-diary) (wow!) and then call my sister for the second time in a day to debrief and because I'm feeling melancholy.

***11:00 pm***: I hop in the shower and make a good faith effort to detangle my hair before turning in around 11:30.

**Daily Total $0**

&#x200B;

**Day Three (Thursday)**

***04:13 am***: Once again, I wake up and can't get back to sleep, which is really frustrating.  I cancel my alarm and shoot an email to my therapist asking if she has availability on Saturday. While it could just be jetlag, I have PTSD and the first sign that I could be entering a difficult season is an inability to sleep. I catch up on my budget on YNAB and I also complete my expense report for this week's trip so I can get reimbursed on time.

***06:00 am:*** I attend to my coffee, clothing and skincare routine before trying to figure out who dropped a 7:00 am call on my calendar for this morning. *Ugh.* The call requires me to review a contract and some background data so I decline the invitation and ask for them to push it back by an hour to give me time to read the agreement. I finish a cursory review before hopping in the car at 7:45. It's a downpour outside and, when I dial into the call at 8:00 from the road, I have to shout to be heard. We work through the main issues by 8:45 and I arrive at the office shortly thereafter.

***09:00 am:*** I dig into email and contract requests that I delayed while I was on vacation and/or traveling for work. I delegate 50% of the work to outside counsel and send an email requesting a chat with the relationship partner about a junior I don't care for that he keeps staffing on our matters. I send 25% of the requests to one of my teammates since they were incorrectly directed to me and draft up a to-do list for the remaining agreements.

***09:30 am:*** My boss asks if I want coffee - *yes* \- and we head down to the Starbucks kiosk and get lattes. My boss pays. We catch up about questions which arose during yesterday's trip and catch up about general issues percolating through our department.

***10:15 am:*** I revise the agreement from this morning's call and then hunker down and work through my to-do list. I get a call from my foster agency asking if I can take two-year-old twins temporarily and immediately decline. I am very much aware of my limitation and twins is definitely at the outer bounds.

*(Note: I feel guilty about this for the rest of the day and end up calling the caseworker back to confirm she was able to place them; she was).*

***12:00 pm***: Head down to our cafeteria for lunch with two other attorneys in our group. I eat instant-pot [Chicken Barbacoa](https://www.thekitchenwhisperer.net/2017/04/21/10-minute-pressure-cooker-chicken-barbacoa/) I prepped on Sunday with rice, beans, corn, pepper jack cheese, and sour cream. My colleagues update me on everything that happened over the past couple of days (spoiler: nothing).

I'm still feeling peckish after lunch so I propose we grab some ice cream and we head out in my car. We get blizzards and shoot the breeze until 1:30 when we finally get back to the office. **($3.79)**

***1:54 pm:*** Grab my intern and sit through four conference calls in a row; ask her to make the resulting changes to the contracts. I'll have to refine her changes a bit but it's a good experience for her and none of the projects are urgent. In the meantime, I edit some emails, revise and send a couple of menacing letters and finalize one more agreement before heading home.

I call Fidelity from the car to try to figure out why my 2019 contributions to my Traditional IRA won't convert into my Roth IRA online. Together, we figure the issue out quickly and they complete the conversion over the phone. I chat with my sister, K, and another sister, E, for the rest of the way home.

***6:00 pm:*** Get home and realize my new car seat has arrived (I gave my other one to someone who needed it); I install it since I'm babysitting my niece (the best baby ever!) next week and she will need to use it. One hour, and a sweaty mess, later - It's done. I also see a calendar alert pop up to call my friend, J, to catch up with her. She and I chat for an hour or so about her new dog, new marriage and life in general. I've been a little frustrated that she doesn't seem very interested about what is going on in my life but, in typical me fashion, I find myself unable to articulate this feeling and let it ride. We schedule brunch for next weekend.

***08:00 pm***: Realize I forgot to eat dinner and heat up some more Chicken Barbacoa which I put on some cauliflower rice. Eat at my computer while finalizing a financial plan for a new client. I also draft up a quick to-do list for tomorrow, finalize some contracts, take a quick shower and then make a little progress on the book I've been reading, ""[Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in A Silicon Valley Startup](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078VW3VM7/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1)"" before turning in at midnight in hopes that staying up later will help me sleep a bit better.

**Daily Total: $3.79**

&#x200B;

**Day Four (Friday):**

***04:17 am***: Same drill. Can't sleep ... whatever. Decide to make the most of it. Grab my computer from the other room and do a little YNAB gardening, including adding in yesterday's transactions and sticking my paycheck into a ""carryforward"" category to use for next month. *Yay Pay Day.*

I also do some research on a financial planning issue a client is having. An hour later, and as I suspected, something she did with an investment account is going to have some adverse tax consequences. Whomp whomp. I draft an email briefing my business partner on the issue and then shove some workout clothes into a bag. I'm out the door by 6:00.

***6:05 am:*** I stop to grab an iced coffee **($2.86)** on my way into the office and, since it is so early, I avoid traffic and manage to get the office by 6:32. I grab a primo parking spot and head to our gym to snag a spot on a Peloton bike and get in a quick ride. I shower, run through my morning routine and then head up to my desk by 7:45. I triage my email and start churning out contracts and emails. I break for an agonizingly long (and valueless) meeting and then pick back up on my contract reviews through lunch.

***12:30 pm***: Head to the fridge with my coworkers and realize I forgot my lunch at home. I have to buy a salad (spinach, chicken, feta, shredded carrots, beets, black beans, peas, banana peppers, and crumbled bacon) from the cafeteria.  **($8.54)**

I update and submit two expense reports for conferences I am attending after lunch before returning to the grind. My energy starts to fade around 3:00, so I take a brain break, check the markets and snack on Smokehouse Almonds I keep in my desk for energy. A friend pops by to ask me about her retirement plan and we shoot the breeze about her three kids for a while.

***4:45 pm:*** My brain has had enough this week and I decide to head home to avoid Friday night traffic into the city. I realize immediately that I left too late to really avoid traffic and put on an episode of the [Harry Potter and the Sacred Text](http://www.harrypottersacredtext.com/) podcast to get me through standstill traffic. My ex-boyfriend, M, texts me in the car and I roll my eyes and wonder what it says the rest of the way home.

***6:00 pm***: Finally home! I read the ""can we talk sometime?"" text from M and roll my eyes further before typing out a courteous, but to the point, ""no."" I put my phone on airplane mode (because avoidance is a legitimate strategy) and then dive into a salad with beets, chicken, and feta on top. Once I've inhaled that, I spend the next couple of hours catching up on contracts over bourbon. I close the evening by reading, first a bit more of ""Bad Blood"" and then start ""[The Body Keeps the Score](https://www.amazon.com/Body-Keeps-Score-Healing-Trauma/dp/0143127748)"" (a book about how trauma affects the body). Go to sleep at 11:30 or so.

**Daily Total: $11.40**

&#x200B;

**Day Five (Saturday):**

***3:17 am***: My memoir shall be titled ""Sleepless in Chicago"". I peek at my phone to catch the time and roll my eyes at how my body is playing me. I get out of bed and stretch in the dark before laying back down. If I don't fall asleep within thirty minutes - I vow to get up for the day.

***6:15 am***: Slept for three additional hours! It's far too hot outside for a run, so I do a yoga video instead and then hop in the shower and run through my morning routine (sans coffee, which I do not drink on the weekend). I tidy up the kitchen and break down a bunch of Amazon boxes and set them out for recycling as I make my way to my therapist office. Her office is only 1 mile away but given the heat and my plans for the day, I drive.

Our session is not terribly productive; it's mostly catching up since I haven't seen her since October of last year but she agrees that everything I'm experiencing does seem to match up with my depressive episodes in the past. She also makes a comment that she thinks I'm handling my PTSD in a healthy way but internally, I know that not to be true - of course I don't say that out loud because sometimes I lie by omission to my therapist. *Super healthy.* Anyway, we plan on meeting in a couple of weeks and I cough up my co-pay. **($25)**

***10:00 am***: I swing by my friend's house to pick up her three-year-old daughter, S, and while I'm strapping her into the car seat (my friend and I swap cars because car seat swapping is not for the faint of heart) she keeps shouting ""park, park, park"" over and over again. I really don't want heatstroke but we *compromise* and go to the park for anyway. She gets hot and we hop back in the car to hit up a home depot for one of their free kids' workshop. We are supposed to be building a birdhouse but she's pretty happy with a single piece of wood she names ""Fart"" (hilarious). We swipe some paint on it and pick up her certificate and apron before heading back to her parents' around noon. I generously allow my friend to keep Fart when I drop S off.

***1:00pm:*** I run to a quick meeting with my business partner and a client at Spoke & Bird over an oat milk lavender latte and salad ($16.87, expensed on business card) to give her my thoughts on a tax issue (I ❤️ the tax code) she is working through and to catch up generally about transitioning the business over to me. I drive her back to her house because it's so hot outside.

***2:30 pm:*** I told another friend I would help her paint a room in her house today so I text her to make sure we are still on and she confirms. I head to her house and catch up with her, her husband, and her daughter (2-1/2) until about 5:30 when I head back home. I get waylaid and swing by a third friend's house to pick up a book for our book club and end up eating dinner with her and hanging for a couple of hours before *finally* getting home.

***10:00 pm***: I immediately drop my bags, strip, pour myself a glass of rose and watch old episodes of Parks and Recreation while updating this log and then working on a few contracts.

***12:00 am***: I go to bed exhausted.

**Daily Total: $25.00**

&#x200B;

**Day Six (Sunday):**

***7:00 am:*** I slept! \[Insert praise jig here\]. I hop out of bed and chug a glass of water mixed with collagen peptides (I've got old joints). It's raining so I ditch the idea of working out and finish ""[Bad Blood](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078VW3VM7/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1)"" instead. I get a call while I'm reading from a blocked number and, since I'm 98% sure it's my biological mother, I try to send it to voicemail and end up answering instead. In a panic, I drop the phone before hanging it up. I get a second call but I'm more coordinated this time around and send the call to voicemail. One minute later and I get confirmation it was her when she leaves a saccharine message about how she misses me. (I roll my eyes and shove the anxiety which accompanies her calls down into my stomach - *I already mentioned I'm ""super"" emotionally healthy above).*

***10:00 am***: The anxiety keeps creeping but after some mindfulness exercises help me move on and start my day. One of my college friends, K, is in town and we made plans for brunch so I text her to confirm we are still on. In reviewing the reservation, I realize I scheduled us for the wrong Sunday. I call to adjust the reservation but they don't have space. I'm irrationally annoyed with myself but make reservations elsewhere, get ready and swing by the first restaurant to pick up K. The food at the second spot is delicious and the conversation is outstanding. We talk about everything under the sun, including the call from my mother, my recent breakup (and hers), and our long term goals.  Some ""bros"" sit down near us and start drunkenly shouting so I pay the bill and we relocate. **($77.67, including tip).**

***2:00 pm***: We head to Ipsento 606 and get matching decaf Rose Cardamom lattes with oat milk - K pays - and continue our restorative conversation. She's an exceptional listener and one of my favorite people. Unfortunately, all good things must come to an end, and at 4:00 pm, I drop her at the train station and try not to be sad that we don't live closer. (**$4.00, parking)**

***5:00 pm***: Traffic is hot garbage and it takes me an hour to get back home. I grab some of the coriander lasagna I made (and froze) a couple of weeks ago out of the freezer and pop a square of it into the oven. I'm not hungry but I know that's depression/melancholy talking so I force myself to eat while watching Parks and Recreation.

My older sister, A,  calls and I chat with her for an hour about life and some mental health challenges she is facing. As the self-appointed ""caretaker"" in our family, I have a horrible habit of making her problems my own.  Thankfully, despite some worrying remarks she seems to be doing better, in general. I jot some notes in my journal about my anxiety so I have something concrete to talk about in therapy in a couple of weeks.

***7:00 pm***: I finalize some contracts that I should have sent out on Friday and endure a late-night conference call which is mostly in mandarin. I make the requested changes to the contract and circulate it to the full team for review and translation. I also pack my suitcase for Monday and Tuesday since I am heading to our second office location on Monday afternoon.

***10:00 pm:*** It's late by the time I sit down to look into brainspotting, a therapeutic technique K mentioned earlier in the day. I read a couple of articles on it and shoot a text to K telling her I miss her before calling it a night.

**Daily Total: $81.67**

&#x200B;

**Day Seven (Monday)**

***04:30 am***: Sleepless in Chicago: Part II. *Whomp.* I get up, pour beans into my machine's hopper and brew some coffee. After finishing my morning routine, I finish packing my bag and hustle downstairs to my car. I get into the office by 6:30 and after grabbing some decaf coffee (free), I start and make good progress on ""[Where the Crawdads Sing](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0735219095/ref=s9_acsd_al_bw_c_x_2_w?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-2&pf_rd_r=W09ES2NVP83BVSX5P9Y7&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=f85909ac-da3a-4421-8325-e5a465f69c9a&pf_rd_i=549028)"" (which I borrowed from the library through Libby) on my kindle before starting on my to-do list at 9:00 am. Over the past couple of days, I've received a few interesting legal questions and do some research on how to respond. I draft up some responses to run by my boss.

***12:00 pm:*** I break for lunch and grab a salad **($8.19)** with the same coworkers and hurry back for a 1:00 pm meeting regarding a new vendor we need to get under contract. The vendor has a lot of comments and I talk my team through the revisions, take notes on their thoughts and indicate I'll get them a revised draft before the end of the week. One of my team members follows me out the door with an unexpected intellectual property question, which I capture in an email and forward to our IP counsel. I head out shortly after to relocate to our second office.

***2:45 pm***: I'm on the road and make good time despite stopping for gas ($49.18, expensed) and some McDonald's french fries ($1.89, expensed). I get to my hotel by 5:45 pm and change into my pajamas before powering up my computer and responding to emails which were sent after I left the office. I order a room service goat cheese and beet salad and put it on my corporate credit card.

***7:45 pm:*** I come across a voicemail (ours are sent over email) for a time-sensitive matter out of one of our Canadian offices and spend an hour or so walking the business team through the various concerns before counseling them on my recommended next steps. I draft a summary of the call and forward it along to my boss so we are on the same page.

***10:00 pm***: I set my alarm and turn in for the evening.

**Response to the Week:** This diary was from last week and other than not going grocery shopping this week, this was pretty representative of my spending. I am not a big spender by any stretch and work a lot which results in many of my expenses being reimbursed. Three other points (i) I don't feel as busy as my diary reads, (ii) I usually only travel once or twice a month, so traveling twice in a week was very unusual and (iii) I usually intermittent fast but I fell off when I traveled to Europe and am just restarting again. I welcome questions!","Ugh, I might get crap for posting this, but I see so many MDs with incorrect nutrition information and wildly expensive shopping habits that I just need to speak! I went to grad school for nutritional sciences. My research was around food deserts and the impact of marketing on food purchasing decisions. If you have any questions, let me know, or if you are also a nutritional scientist/ RD feel free to jump in! 

Here are a few things I feel are important especially if you are struggling to afford things you feel like you need because of social media, advertising, etc: 

1. Nutrition varies person to person. Our bodies are all different. Our genes can affect how our body handles different supplements, foods, diets etc. Something that someone swears by may not work for you and could possibly harm you. 

2. VITAMINS AND MINERALS. Synthetic forms of vitamins and minerals were developed for a reason. Some vitamins like folic acid are actually more bioavailable than their dietary counterparts (folate). That is why many foods in the US are fortified with these forms of vitamins and minerals. The dietary and “synthetic” forms of vitamins and minerals may differ in structure and how they are absorbed, but at the end of the day they are broken down into the same components in the body for the same goal. I know we would all love to get all our nutrients from whole foods, but that’s just not always conceivable. Taking vitamins are a great way to ensure you’re covering all your bases, and they don’t have to expensive. Buying brands that are USP or NSF certified is good, but big brands or generic brands usually have their own labs to test amounts too. CVS sells a yearly supply of multivitamins for $20! 

3. SUPPLEMENTS. For the love of god stop wasting money on beauty vitamins. Deficiency in biotin causes brittle hair and nails, but having a deficiency in biotin is SO rare. Getting an excess amount does nothing. Maybe your skin, hair and nails look better because you’re actually getting the nutrients you need because you are taking a vitamin, but you don’t need specific “beauty” ones. 

4. Organic fruits and veg. Ugh, this one makes me sad. Studies have shown that people who can’t afford organic refrain from buying fruits and vegetables at all because they’ve been scared by marketing that makes you think non-organic is bad for you. Organic produce and foods can be great in other aspects, but they really aren’t any better for you than conventional produce. Also, genetically modified fruits and veg (“GMOs”) are also just as healthy. It’s ok to be an organic, whole food wellness goddess if you have the budget for it, but spreading this kind of misinformation can really negatively impact a lot of people.

5. Research. If you are ever doing your own nutrition research, search for sites that end in .edu or .gov. This information will generally be more reliable and less bias. I’ve seen so many websites and blogs pull very specific things out of research studies just to make their case for something that actually isn’t what the research was saying at all. Or better yet write your questions down and ask an expert!","I love reading about what other people eat, sorry not sorry! I love reading the details of other people’s trader joe hauls and avocado toast recipes. I know this isn’t directly related to the money diaries posted here but food is obviously something we all spend a good chunk of money on monthly.

    Travel Expenses

**Flights**

I flew standard economy on Air Canada from O’Hare to Narita, with a layover in Vancouver both directions. My roundtrip total inclusive of taxes/fees/etc was: **$879.54**

**Accomodations**

I decided to stay mostly in hostels, both to save money and hopefully make some friends! I had originally booked one night in a ryokan (traditional Japanese inn) as a treat but had to cancel this last minute due to a typhoon hitting pretty hard the week before I arrived. I ended up bouncing around a lot between cities (intentional) and within cities (less intentional) because I originally planned to add an additional day in Tokyo, but switched this to Kyoto day-of.

* Tokyo hostel #1: 3 nights - **$114.22**
* Tokyo hostel #2:1 night, cancelled day of, did not get refund - **$34.45**
* Kyoto hostel #1: 1 night- **$17.41**
* Kyoto hostel #2: 2 nights - **$58.64**
* Osaka hostel: 1 night - **$20.16**
* Tokyo hostel #3: 1 night - **$27.39**

**Total: 272.27**

&#x200B;

**Pre Trip Purchases**

I’m listing these here but won’t include them in the final roundup, because these are all things I needed already and will definitely use again.

* New hard-side carry-on (the wheels on my my 6 year old Walmart one were going): **$55**
* Packing cubes: **$12.99**
* Portable power bank: **$55.10**

&#x200B;

**A general note:** Japan is a cash-only society. When doing my own budgeting I rely really heavily on credit card records and Personal Capital because my brain is bad, so not having digital or physical receipts for a lot of these transactions means some of them are estimates. Anything where I don’t have the exact amount is indicated with a \~ and any rounding done is always within 100yen / $1 usd, but I wanted to be transparent that my records aren’t cent-perfect. (Anything without a \~ is one where I did record the exact amount.)

&#x200B;

    Friday 10/18

* I came down with a pretty bad cold in the days right before I left, so I treat myself to a Lyft to the airport instead of taking the bus to the blue line: **$28.96**
* At the airport, I buy a USB to USB-C cord because I didn’t realize the power bank I bought didn’t come with one. The Hudson News price is literally quadruple what I’d pay on Amazon, but that’s the idiot tax. I also buy a Cherry Coke Zero: **$36.90**

**Daily total: $65.86**

&#x200B;

    Saturday 10/19  

* I land in Narita around 4pm local time, at what feels like 2am body time. It’s rough. I buy a SIM card with 14 days of pre-paid unlimited data, and install it myself. All prices from now on are in yen and converted to USD: **$51.32**
* I buy a ticket for the express train into the city: **$29.78**
* I also buy a green tea from a vending machine: **$1.28**
* I ALSO pick up a refillable Suica card (contactless refillable train pass). I put $9.17 on it, but don’t use it yet; I’ll note train fares as I use them.
* After I check in at my hostel in Shibuya, I go to a ramen place down the street and get an extremely delicious bowl of tsukumen ramen. **$9.16**

**Daily total: $91.54**

&#x200B;

    Sunday 10/20  

* Wake up in the middle of the night because jet-lag is a bitch. Wait until it’s almost a decent hour, then go to 7-11 to withdraw some cash and get food. I buy a mandarin orange yogurt, some prepackaged pancakes with syrup, and a bottled iced coffee for around: **\~$3.66**
* I intentionally didn’t bring a lot of my toiletries because I knew I wanted to buy some in Japan, so I go to Don Quijote to pick some up. I buy BB cream, mascara, an eyeshadow single, makeup remover/face wash, sunscreen, a solid perfume stick, and nail polish: **\~$54.97**
* I go to yoyogi park and walk through and it’s absolutely beautiful and serene. Orange tea from vending machine: **$1.19**
* After the park, I go to Meiji Shrine, which is also beautiful and serene. After this, I go to Harajuku and walk around the main shopping streets, which are crazy and overwhelming. I stop and get pork katsu curry for lunch: **$9.89**
* After this, I take the train to Shimokitazawa: **$2.51**
* In Shimokitazawa, I get a latte called “the Dirty” from Bear Pond Espresso and it is literally the best coffee anything I have ever had in my entire life. **$5.31**
* I wander around thrift shopping for a while. I love browsing the racks and seeing how different the styles are, but I’m 5’7 and a US 8/10 which means literally nothing here comes close to fitting. I do manage to find a cool oversized denim jacket though, which has been on my list to find for AGES now: **$22.07**
* I am now extremely tired so I buy a flat white from a different coffee shop. It’s good, but nowhere near as good as the other drink I had: **$4.21**
* I take the train back to my hostel, where I lay down and rest for around an hour, but I don’t let myself fall asleep just yet **$1.65**
* Then I’m going to Seirinkan, a pizza place that’s supposed to be absolutely legendary…and it is. I get a Margherita pizza that is absolutely some of the best pizza I have ever had. I’m very sad I can’t finish it but it’s an entire pizza and I am only one woman. I also get an Aperol spritz. **$20.81**
* I take the train one stop to a cool bar I found online: **$1.26**
* The bar is called Bar Martha and it’s a super cool vibe; they have a huge sound system and someone playing classic rock songs on vinyl. I get two absolutely fantastic Moscow mules made with fresh ginger and listen to some Beatles deep cuts: **$22.92**
* I walk back to the hostel and pass out the instant my head hits the pillow.

**Daily total: $150.45**

&#x200B;

    Monday 10/21

* Jet lag strikes again. I get an iced latte from a coffee stand on the way to the train station: **$4.49**
* Take the train to the Tsukiji Outer Fish Market (even with jet lag, I was NOT up to the 3am tuna auction): **\~$1.83**
* I get easily overwhelmed/anxious in heavy crowds, so at the fish market I do an initial pass through and then end up on a side street, where it’s a little easier to breathe. I get a pan au chocolat: **$1.83**
* Now that my blood sugar is up a little, I’m ready. Once more unto the breach and I get octopus on a stick (FANTASTIC): **$4.12**
* Eel on a stick: **$1.83**
* The best iced matcha latte I’ve ever had: **$4.58**
* Done with the fish market, I walk over to Hamarikyu Gardens. They’re absolutely beautiful even in the off-season between summer and fall, where the flowers are dead but the trees are green. Admission: **$2.75**
* After the gardens, I walk across the river to TeamLab Planets (this walk takes like 45 minutes and is much more industrial than it looked on google maps oops). I pre-bought my ticket online, so I only had to wait in line for less than ten minutes. The exhibition experience was SO cool, especially the room where I was in water up to my knees and could interact with the koi holograms. **$29.54**
* I take the train back to Ginza vs walking this time. No contest. **$3.56**
* To feed my caffeine addiction, I go to this classic/historic Japanese style coffee house and get a tiny brewed cup of some fancy single-origin dark roast. It was delicious but it was not worth the: **$8.25**
* I have some time to kill before my dinner reservation so I stop at Uniqlo. I can technically fit into the L/XL but they don’t quite hang right, and I know the Japanese style for loose, calf-length skirts isn’t going to play super well back home so I don’t buy anything.
* My dinner reservation is at a place I found in an Eater article for a full sushi omakase experience. Most of the sushi is incredibly delicious, but some of it is really not my thing and I have no clue what I’m actually eating because it’s in Japanese. I also learned later via google that my absolute favorite bite of the evening turned out to be ………..fish sperm. Great. **$60.50**
* I then go to this amazing bar called Bar Orchard. You pick a seasonal fruit out of a pile they have, and then they turn it into a custom cocktail for you, and serve it in really creative ways. I get a sour pear gin cocktail that’s served in a little bathtub, complete with edible sea salt bubbles and rubber duck, and then later I get a pomegranate rum cocktail in a little ziplock bag printed like a mason jam jar. I made some friends and their drinks included: a plum old fashioned where they set a pine cone on fire, something served in a tiny plastic trash can, something involving absinthe they drank out of a watering can. VERY gimmicky, very fun, very delicious. **$47.67**
* I take the train back to my hostel. After I get off at the station, I’m pausing to make sure I’m going the right way and a guy comes up to me and offers to buy me a drink in exchange for practicing his English. OBVIOUSLY my internal common sense radar is saying not to do this, but every single person I talked to said this happens a lot in Japan and is not creepy or weird, and I’m pretty drunk already, so I agree. He was already being kind of persistent and following me down the street so like an IDIOT I thought maybe if I had one drink this would get rid of him. This was obviously a mistake; I end up having to invent a boyfriend (his name is Alex he’s a vet student we’re very happy etc) and walk twenty minutes out of my way before he left me alone and I finally felt safe enough to actually go to my real hostel location. Trust your instincts, guys (although yeah this one was………I don’t know what I was thinking). **$1.82 f**or the train; the rest cost only my dignity.

**Daily Total: $172.77**

&#x200B;

    Tuesday 10/22  

* I finally (FINALLY) sleep later than 3am. 9:30 baby!!!!! Despite being much better rested, I’m feeling kind of anxious and gross and overwhelmed by Tokyo, so I make the last-minute decision I mentioned earlier to go to Kyoto a day early. The hostel I already booked is full, but one relatively nearby is cheap and free so I make the reservation (price noted above) and check out.
* I get the fluffy Instagram pancakes from Flipper. I thought they would be overrated but they are truly soooooo good. I also get a coffee. **$13.75**
* I take the train to the main Shinkansen connection: **$1.72**
* Once there, I get a Shinkansen ticket to Kyoto: **$129.79**
* Vending machine green tea: **1.47**
* Once I arrive in Kyoto, I buy a vending machine lemon soda: **$1.28**
* Then I walk over to my hostel and check in. The walk is beautiful and really peaceful as I cross the river, and I’m immediately super glad that I came to Kyoto early instead of sticking it out in Tokyo. Once at my hostel, I’m charged an additional tax on top of what I prepaid online. **$1.83**
* Get on the train to Gion, the historic geisha district, and wander around a bunch. It’s beautiful after dark, with the old buildings lit up and the stream and everything. I see what I think might actually be a real geisha; there’s also a crowd of tourists literally running behind her with cameras which I think is very rude. **$1.47**
* After walking around for a few hours, I’m hungry; I stop at a cute place and get an order of gyoza and a glass of plum wine. **$9.62**
* I now walk across the river towards Nishiki market. I get fried chicken from a stand the people I met at the bar last night recommended and it is literally the best friend chicken I have ever had in my entire life. **$2.75**
* I stop at Daiso, which is essentially a dollar store, and get some cute stickers, greeting cards, a pack of those spiral hair ties, band aids because I’m getting some blisters/hot spots, and some random snacks/candy. **$7.06**
* I go back to the chicken stand. Yes, it’s really that good. The guy recognizes me and gives me extra chicken this time; I am simultaneously delighted and ashamed. **2.75**
* I stop at a cool looking bar on my way back. It’s also rock and roll themed (not sure why this is such a thing here!) I get two drinks: one is some lychee liqueur and grapefruit juice and is AMAZING, and one is beer and orange soda and is terrible. The bartender is super nice and takes requests and I get him to play Rumours by Fleetwood Mac in its entirety. Iconic. We have a really fun conversation via Google translate; it’s one of the highlights of the trip. **$12.83**
* Train back to hostel: **$1.47**

**Daily total: $187.79**

&#x200B;

    Wednesday 10/23  

* Jet lag returns. I stop at Family Mart for breakfast and get a chocolate chip melon bun, a hot bottled coffee because apparently they have those here, and also blister band-aids. **\~$6.87**
* I take the train to Nijo Castle: **\~$3.67**
* I also leave my suitcase in a locker at the train station: **$3.67**
* Nijo castle is absolutely beautiful, both inside and the gardens, and ends up being my favorite place I visited the whole trip. It’s amazing and worth every penny of the admission**: $9.62**
* One of my favorite parts of the castle was the silk painted tapestries on the walls of pine trees, tigers, eagles, flowers, and more. From the gift shop I buy what they call “towels” but look more like screen printed fabric with those designs that I plan to hang up at home:  **$13.20**
* Vending machine green tea: **$1.47**
* Train to Southern Higashiyama district: **$2.02**
* I do a traditional Japanese tea ceremony! It’s super cool to learn about the history of the ceremony, and also to learn how to properly make matcha. Also it is delicious. I pre-booked this online for: **$28.71**
* I walk around a little and then get tempura udon for lunch: **$11.46**
* I walk around a little more and then stop for matcha ice cream: **$3.21**
* I walk around a bunch and go to various temples along the philosophers path, but don’t end up paying the admission to go inside any of them / others are free. I regret this a little but weirdly you kind of get burned out on temples (I know.)
* Vending machine peach flavored black tea (this becomes my new fav): **$1.47**
* More philosophers path! This is so cool and beautiful and it’s kind of a grey day right before sunset and I’m listening to Lana Del Rey and the mood is fantastic but also my feet hurt so when I reach the northern end, I take the bus back to the train station where I left my suitcase: **$2.02**
* And then another train back to my hostel: **$1.47**
* I end up eating dinner at the restaurant at my hostel just because I’m too tired to look for something or walk around. I get fish and chips and a local craft beer: **$13.75**
* I planned on going to bed super early, but I end up striking up a conversation with some other people at the restaurant/bar. They end up being from California and are all super nice and fun and we get along really well! I tell them about the bar I went to last night and they’re intrigued, so we walk over. I get a random drink of something Japanese I’ve never heard before that tastes very … botanical. **$6.42**
* My new bffs all got more than one drink each so they decide we should go do karaoke in one of those places with private rooms. I agree. It’s very very very fun. We get sake there because there’s a 1 drink/person minimum and that’s the cheapest thing on the menu. Someone with better Japanese pays and tells me my share is **$4.58.**

**Daily total: $113.61**

&#x200B;

    Thursday 10/24  

* Wake up super early again and it’s pouring rain. I realize later this was literally a typhoon lol it just didn’t hit Kyoto especially hard. I go to 7-11 to buy breakfast and get an egg sandwich, a hot bottled coffee, and also an umbrella.  **\~$11.00**
* Take the train to Fushimi Inari: **$2.02**
* Luckily I got here really early and also it’s raining so the gate path, which I’ve heard gets really crowded, is quite empty and I can wander around and take pictures and pet some stray cats. It is so beautiful and calming and I love it. I intended to go all the way up the mountain, but I took a wrong turn at some point and ended up accidentally exiting the shrine area entirely via a service road that spits me out in a neighborhood a full train stop away from where I started. Lol oops.
* I take the train to Nara for the rest of my day, a little earlier than intended but oh well. **\~$7.33**
* Arrive in Nara and almost immediately see roaming friendly deer. Get some pets in. Excellent. Then I go to a free garden (beautiful) and then a paid garden (even more beautiful!!!! I have become obsessed with gardens). It’s still pouring rain but it’s so beautiful and lush and green **$8.25**
* I do get quite cold and wet eventually though so I go into a tea house inside the garden and get a cup of matcha and a red bean sweet **$7.79**
* I then walk up to a huge old temple with a huuuuuuuuuge buddha inside and huge huge guardian statues outside. Admission: **$5.50**
* I buy mushroom soba for lunch: **$7.56**
* More temples, free. Vending machine peach tea: **$1.47**
* Mooooore walking around, more temples, more petting of the deer. At some point some really adorable Japanese schoolchildren come up to me and interview me as an assignment for their English class and it. is. so. cute. I eventually spend ages walking around outside in the rain because I wanted to go to this sake distillery for a tasting and I thought it opened at 5. It closes at 5. Kill me.
* I’m so annoyed by this and also so wet and my feet hurt so much that I just get on a train back to Kyoto **\~$7.33**
* I get back and I’m too tired to figure out dinner so I just get a bunch of 7-11 snacks and drinks and hang out in the hostel lounge reading. I become a huge fan of the \~$1.50 a can 9% abv apple flavored shochu drinks. **$7.48**

**Daily total: $65.73**

&#x200B;

    Friday 10/25

* Then I get the bus to Kyoto Station: **$2.02**
* Locker for my suitcase: **$4.58**
* Train to Arashiyama: **$2.38**
* I walk around the bamboo forest a bunch. It’s very beautiful but pretty crowded and still pouring rain and it’s not a good combo. I was planning on doing another temple and the monkey park here as well but I’m super not feeling it so I take the train back to central Kyoto **$2.38**
* I go to this cool tea shop and do a tasting ($10.08) and then buy a bunch of tea for myself, as well as for gifts for my mom ($50.42): **$60.50**
* I walk back through the market and end up ducking into a cute boutique where I get 3 pairs of handmade earrings; one for myself, two as gifts for my roommate. **$23.37**
* I was going to go to the chicken stand again and get more (YES I have a problem) but it was closed. Grab a doner kebab wrap for lunch instead. **$4.58**
* There’s a direct route to Osaka from the train line I’m currently closest to, but my luggage is still back at the Kyoto Station so I take the bus there: **$2.02**
* Train to Osaka: **$4.58**
* Check into my hostel, lie down and relax a little, and then head over to Dotonbori market to get dinner. There’s a ton of places that look good but are full, or don’t have English menus, or something else, but I eventually end up at a yakiniku place. I get wagyu beef (that I grill myself!) and a beer. **$41.25**
* I walk over to another cool bar recommended online, another one that does custom drinks based on what you request flavor wise. This one is super hidden speakeasy style and I almost don’t find it, which is a fun adventure all on its own. I have two drinks. **$24.75**
* I stop and get 7-11 chips and a chocolate bar on my way back to the hostel. **$2.75**

**Daily Total: $182.49**

* Train to Osaka castle: **\~$4.58**
* 7-11 breakfast of pan au chocolat and bottled hot coffee: **$3.21**
* Luggage locker: **$3.67**
* I walk around Osaka castle and take a ton of pictures of the outside and the moats and explore some of the grounds. It’s super beautiful and cool and ENORMOUS. I’d heard the inside isn’t worth the price of admission so I head back to the train station. On the way, I see a takoyaki stand and get some, since it’s an Osaka specialty. (I kind of hate it, but I’m glad I gave it a try.) **$4.58**
* Snacks for train (potato straw thingies, canned drink bc Japan doesn’t have open container laws) **$2.24**
* Take shinkansen back to Tokyo. I get a window seat and am able to see Mount Fuji outside the window as we go past which is VERY VERY COOL. Also legal day drinking on public transportation really does elevate the experience. **$134.93**
* Get back to Tokyo Station and go to Ramen street, which is located below the station. Get a very good bowl of some sort of shrimp ramen: **$8.62**
* Take train to my final hostel and check in. **$1.82**
* This hostel is in Asakusa which is kind of near the kitchen supply district and I wanna get some SOUVENIRS/gifts so I head back out right away before the shops close.
* I get an all-purpose stainless steel chefs knife. I was originally shopping for my brother but I pick this knife up one time and immediately realize I want it for myself so I …. buy it for myself. **$99.00**
* At a different knife shop, I see a carbon steel meat/vegetable knife that I think will be good for my brother. It’s not as nice as the one I bought myself, but it looks cooler and more authentically Japanese **$64.17**
* I go to Uniqlo because I literally am out of shirts. I get a mockneck sweater so I have something clean to wear tomorrow and a zip-up teddy fleece because I’ve been missing out on this trend. **$28.13**
* I go to Don Quijote for more souvenirs. I get Pokemon face masks for my friend, and a ton of candy including 4 flavors of kit-kats for everyone, including myself. **$30.30**
* I stop at Lawson and get the chicken nuggets that are supposed to be amazing. They’re pretty good but they still taste like chicken nuggets from a convenience store tbh. **2.60**
* Walk around Sensoji temple at night; it’s beautiful all lit up.
* Stop at a bar that looks cute and get a Negroni. **$12.83**
* Get some snacks before I head back to my hostel since I didn’t really eat dinner: **$3.88**

**Daily Total: $404.56** (yikes!)

&#x200B;

    Sunday 10/27  

* Go to a coffee shop that’s supposed to be really amazing and buy my dad some really nice coffee that’s roasted there. I also get myself a cortado because I need caffeine to live and I’m still waking up at 5am. **$22.00**
* Go to Don Quijote and get my dad a mini bottle of some pretty bad whiskey (he’s more of a coffee drinker than a whiskey drinker; it’s more about the novelty of the label): **$4.95**
* Go to this cool store that makes super detailed plastic replicas of food and buy my friend a magnet with a replica of sea urchin sushi: **$15.86**
* Take the train a few stops to Ueno Park: **$1.72**
* Luggage locker: **$6.42**
* Go to Ichiran and get a bowl of customized ramen. There’s a bit of a wait but it’s worth it: **$10.08**
* Go to the convenience store and buy a white grape flavored Strong Zero: **$1.42**
* Walk around Ueno Park and the pond; it’s a really beautiful day. Find a bench and sit and drink my strong zero and watch the people on the swan/paddle boats and just really enjoy my last hour or so here.
* Time to go :( back to station, buy ticket on Skyliner back to Narita Airport: **$23.19**
* After I make it back through security etc etc, I have about an hour to kill so I try to use up the very last of my yen. Buy another lemon soda, another peach tea, and some random snacks. I’m left with less than $1 on my refillable transit card and about 35 cents in cash, which I feel v smug about.  **$5.87**

**Daily Total: 91.51**

* Chickpea kale salad: **$12.34**
* Tim Hortons latte and timbits: **$4.75**
* Chips and Coke Zero: **$4.54**
* When I arrive back in Chicago, I intend to take the blue line back home, especially since I haven’t been able to switch the SIM cards back out and my phone isn’t working. However the blue line is totally and mysteriously fucked so I get on O’Hare wifi and order a Lyft share home. **$29.56**

    Reflection

I spent a LOTTTT on this trip but ultimately I do think it was all worth it! I haven't done a ton of traveling before this and I saved up for ages to go; both consciously for a few months since I started planning and before that just keeping ""international travel"" as a vague future goal to motivate me to live below my means and try not to splash out too much. I didn't gain any credit card debt from this trip whatsoever. The things I would change in the future are 1) looking harder for cheap flights 2) I don't currently get any miles/points/whatever from a travel card, I do cash back only, and I know some people save a ton doing that kind of churning."," **Assets and Debts**

**Retirement Balance:** **(and how you got there):**   $117,000 currently because I just borrowed $18k from myself for M's 1st year of school. I put in $300 pre-tax per month which is matched. I also get a $6-8k bonus each year which I put in as well. 

**Savings Account Balance:**  I have two savings accounts. One has around $67k in it. I move $500 each month when I get paid. This is for...who knows honestly. It started as a house fund and then Denver prices skyrocketed and my rent is super low and we love where we live. I suppose now it's my moving/not-working/maybe condo purchase one day fund.

The other has $6725 in it - basically whatever is left over in my checking account the night before I get paid again goes into this one. It's my travel/holidays account. We're doing a trip to Greece/Italy and possibly Croatia next summer so this is mostly money saved for that.   

**Checking Account Balance:**  $271. I keep next to nothing in this in general after bills are paid.   

**Credit Card Debt**: $0 - I use one for all things and pay it off each month  

**Income:**

**Monthly Take Home:** Paid 1x a month $3700. 

**Expenses:**  
Rent: $850 for a two bedroom/two bath - this is very very low for our area, but I've lived in the same house for ten years now and my landlord adores us. If I moved right now, I'd be paying over twice that I believe.  
Health care: My company covers this in full for M and I and I'm eternally grateful. I do pay for a short term disability policy that comes out pre-tax for $62.

Medical bill: $150 per month. I was in the ER in May and hit my deductible in one afternoon. I owe around $6500 and while I could pay it off, I'm just unwilling. (Hi, stubborn Taurus here.)

Car loan: $0 I paid my car off 9 months ago. 

Car insurance: $225 Yes this is high, but M is also on it as a minor driver and I got a ticket last October and it went up $50 a month after that. Pro tip: don't get a speeding ticket in a school zone.

401K Loan: This is new and I've only paid one month on it. I borrowed money from myself and I'll pay it back at $500 a month for three years. I'm not fully sure what I'll do for the next few years of her being in college, but I'm not against pulling money again and condensing loans to myself. 

Energy bill: $40-90 a month depending 

Trash and water are paid by my landlord

Internet: $65

Rec center family membership: $52

Cell phone: we're both on my step-dads work plan

Spotify family: $14 (my mom and step-dad are also on it)

Netflix: $15 (my parents use it too)Amazon: $11 

Hulu: Free because I won a gift card worth Hulu no commercials for a year, at work last Christmas. That said, we almost never watch it and when I have to pay for it, I likely will cancel. 

Wine Club X2: One is $49 a month and one is $99 quarterly, but I'm including it because I'll pay for it this month

Kid CC: $250 allowance a month, which I pay off every other month and my brother covers the other months. 

I'll start off by saying that my kid, M, is seventeen and is starting college a year early. She skipped second grade. She'll be going to a big school in Northern California, over half on scholarships this year. I'm hoping for more scholarships going forward, but it is what it is. She's extremely intelligent but also super super athletic and in the last second decided against a full ride sports scholarship to instead go to the school she really wanted to. Hence, me taking out more loans this year than I think I'll have to in the future.

M is biologically my baby sister. I've raised her since she was two and a half and my dad and step-mom died. I was twenty-four at the time and responsible/done with school/had a full time job. I had some help in the very beginning with daycare/health care costs (thank you to the state of Colorado), but she's mine (I adopted her) and it's always been just the two of us.  


**Day one - Monday**

6:32 am - Nope. Hit snooze three times until I finally acquiesce to Monday and get out of bed. Take a quick body wash shower, grab breakfast and lunch and get out the door on time by exactly one minute. Go through the Starbucks drive thru for a venti iced latte. $4.89

8:15 am - Make it to work exactly on time. This won't happen the rest of the week, I'd put money on it. Eyeball the stacks of work on my desk and decide I'm ready to eat my breakfast now. Eat cereal and milk from home. I'm not an adventurous breakfast eater. I eat the same thing pretty much every day. Currently it's Quaker Oats cereal with a sliced banana on top. 

Work on a clients 2018 bookkeeping so I can do her taxes. Nothing like waiting until the last moment. (Extended business taxes are due on the 15th and it's currently the 9th.)

10:00 am - Call M and make sure she's up and going to work. Move in for her school is next weekend and she's only working two more shifts and then going on a small camping trip with a couple friends. She's not only up but apparently cleaned out the fridge and reorganized our pit of a pantry. I love her and don't think I really want her to leave for college. Break into my desk stash of crap and eat two Trader Joes Waffle Cone cookie dipped in cookie swirl butter. Oh hi PMS!

11:00 am - Take a quick break and call my girlfriend S and see if I can take her out on Friday night. She's not working that night and doesn't have her kids this week, so SCORE! It's a newer, casual relationship, but she's a lot of fun. If it weren't for kids and full time jobs and the fact that I'm moving out of state next year, she is someone I could see being serious about. That said, it's a casual thing (although we're only dating each other) and we're both aware of it.

12:15 pm - Realize I'm hungry and heat up my chili and rice from home. Get back to my office and text my office bff that it's been 0 days since a certain annoying coworker has commented on my food. Apparently adding carrots into chili is wrong. Shrug. I enjoy it. One thing I learned early on in parenting is to add extra veggies into foods people don't normally to trick kids, although I never really needed to trick M into eating. All these years later and M and I just still enjoy extra veggies in things. Twelve years at this job and this woman has been the office pain nearly as long. She's one of those people who always has a story to share/beat everything you say. If you lost a limb, she lost three, type of person. She's notorious on rude food comments. I eat at my desk while working so I can take a walk in an hour or so.   
1:30 pm - Walk with my work bff A around the neighborhood for half an hour. We discuss our weekends and my dating life. A has been married for 22 years and has four kids, so I think she likes hearing anything interesting from me.

Work, work and more work. Leave for home at 4:45 pm and call the kid to see if she has plans tonight . She doesn't, so we plan on going to the rec center together.   
5:30 pm - Get home and pick M up and head to the rec center to swim/rock climb. Get there and see that it's closed this week for cleaning. Ugh. Okay, new plan. Pizza, then home and movie night. We stop and get MOD Pizza to go. $18.74 

I do a paint by number painting app on my iPad while we watch TV. I'm incapable of just watching TV. M is too, she's been on her iPad reading the whole time. We watch a few episodes of Mindhunter and then a couple episodes of How I Met Your Mother because WOW that show is intense and then I got to bed around 10pm. No clue when M goes to bed. Teens + summer leads to ridiculous hours. 

Total: $23.63

  
**Day Two - Tuesday:** 

  
6: 32 am - Same as yesterday except I only snooze twice today because I need to wash my hair. Grab the exact same food as yesterday and leave. Make my daily (yes, daily) drive to Starbucks for an iced latte. Starbucks is my kryptonite and I have no regrets about it. $4.89

8:19 am - Get to work. Technically a few minutes late but no one really keeps track or cares. Check my personal email and see that two books I had on hold are ready at the library. Make an alarm on my phone to pick them up after work. I can't seem to find motivation this morning. Not sure I slept well at all last night. I'm anxious about taking M to school next week. She's intelligent and responsible and a truly capable girl, but it's hard for me to let her go. She's been my constant companion for 15 years now. The toddler years took forever, but somehow teen years have sped up to warp speed. Text her a quick good morning and I love you (that she likely won't see for hours) and finally get to work. Send a reminder email to my boss that I'm out all of next week. She knows and it's on her calendar, but she likes being reminded the week prior so she can pile on work. 

10:15 am - Meet with a new client who brings in six years of taxes that were never filed. I'd like to bang my head against the wall. This is something that I hate about my job. It's such a pain to deal with people like this, especially because the same person will act like I've done something wrong when she owes a shit ton of money to the IRS. (Spoiler: she does.) They do not take kindly to people who don't pay. Contemplate waffle cookies and cookie butter as a snack and instead find an apple in our kitchen and eat that instead. 

11:00 am - Talk to my brother J while working. We are very close, as I suppose happens when ones parents are as neglectful as ours were. We basically raised ourselves/each other. Everything I've done and everything I have, I did alone and out of a stubborn will to be better than them. Our parents were never meant to be parents. This is horrible to say out loud I'm sure, but J and I have always said that M has had a great life because my dad and step-mom died. Yes, saying it makes me sound terrible. But they died in a fire, while cooking and using drugs. M had actually been with me for two months already when they died. That should tell you what you need to know about them. Every single day I'm grateful that M was created and born in their one year of sobriety, because I know what meth can do to a fetus. My mom, while not a druggie, wasn't really a mom. She only cared about herself and any man she happened to be with in the moment. My current step-dad is actually the only one who has ever shown any interest in us.   

J and I discuss my apparent mid life crisis. Is 39 too young for one? I'm a CPA and honestly I'm thinking of going back to school to do basically anything but this, not that I have a single clue what I want to do. When I move next year I plan on giving myself six months off to think about it and make a choice. I can always find a job as a CPA, this I know. But that time is something I've never given myself. I picked a career based on ability, not on what I wanted to do in life. The problem being, I was never asked what I wanted to do and never really had some big dream to be something. (Well except six year old me who wanted to be a ballerina.) Anything I've ever done has just been because I pushed myself and then my wanting to provide a stable life for M and I.  
Next summer I'm planning on moving to Northern California and living near J and his fiance who are getting married next spring. It will also put me closer to my best friend E who moved out there two years ago and close to M, which is a great.. I went to something like fifteen schools in twelve years and swore I'd never do that to my kids. M has been in the same school system since preschool and while at times I've wanted to move, I made the conscious choice to raise her here. 

J and M are pretty much my only family. I see my mom and step-dad (he's husband #5) who live a mile from me, maybe once a month, but we're not close. 

12:10 pm - Eat chili and rice for lunch. Debate a fizzy drink but decide against it. Carbonated drinks hurt my stomach so I try to avoid them. I mostly drink water. My annoying coworker doesn't mention my lunch but does harass someone else for their food smelling. Yes, food smells like food when heated up. 

Text some with S about Friday night, trying to get a sense of if she wants to spend the night without actually asking. (I'm truly terrible at this.) She says she'd like Indian food, so I make a reservation for that. She complains to me about her ex husband some and I try and listen and not offer negativity to the conversation. Lets just say he's an ass (albeit a great dad), but I feel like it's not my place to go there. Oh I suppose this is a good place to say that I'm bisexual, as is S. I tend to date mostly women, with an occasional man thrown in. S was married to a man and has only dated two women since her divorce. I suppose I should also add that I almost never introduce people I'm dating to M. I date and she knows it but it doesn't need to involve her in any way. She comes first. 

1:30 pm - Take a walk with A around the neighborhood. Discuss annoying clients and my Friday night date. A mentions that she thinks I'm getting a bit attached to S. Which, yeah she's right. Can't seem to help it, the woman makes me happy. Tell A that it's future me's problem and for now, I'm just along for the ride. I'm moving next year without a doubt and it just may suck when it happens. 

4:45 pm - Am shocked that the afternoon goes by so fast. Summer is very slow in the accounting world, but it speeds up again this time of year. Call M on the way home and she tells me she has plans with a friend. 

5:45 pm - Get home after stopping at a Wizards United stop to fight some pixies. This game is a new addiction for M and I and we're in a race to get to new levels. It's like Pokemon Go, but for Harry Potter. Take a walk around the neighborhood to find more wizard things. Also because I'd normally of swam tonight. I pick up a book at the little free library a block away. Remember I have books on hold at the library. Whoops. (Never managed to pick these up this week.)

At some point I had eggs and toast for dinner while reading the book I found at the free library (Wanderers by Chuck Windig) and then watched Criminal Minds. I've been re-watching it this summer, because next season is their last. Consider opening a bottle of wine and never get around to it. 

Go to bed around 10pm, M comes home a few minutes later and lays in my bed for a bit. She tells me that her purse has a rip, so I tell her to look online and find something on Amazon. We shall see what she sends me tomorrow. Kids always need something.

Total:$4.89

  
**Day Three - Wednesday** 

6:42 am - Only one snooze and I'm up. We have theater tickets tonight, so I want to dress up a bit. Our office is business casual, but today I'm wearing a summery dress and actually do my hair, which is code for not in a pony tail. I''m not much of a girly girl. Aveeno moisturizer is my only face item. Manage to get out of the house mostly on time and drive thru Starbucks, making it to work a few minutes early somehow. $4.89

10:00 am - This morning has been nuts, although I did have some cereal with a cut up peach on top at some point. I take a quick break and talk to my brother on the phone and answer texts from both S and M. M found a purse she wants as well as a pair of boots, surprise, surprise. I tell her to order them, thank you Amazon for your fast delivery. Normally I'd make her pay for her boots, since the child has a metric ton of shoes, but last week she bought a backpack with her personal money, that I'd of bought for her, so I figure it works out. She gets an allowance or really a credit card in my name with a monthly limit, which is for food/gas/whatever. I've recently upped her limit, since she'll be a school. She also has a job and has had one for years and I make her put half of every check into savings which she can't access. The other half is for her to spend on whatever she wants. Which is mostly the three c's: coffee, clothes and concerts. She has my old car and is on my insurance. $129

11 ish -Take a break and play around on my phone for a few. I've been trying to curb my social media use this summer and it mostly has helped my mental health. I don't have a lot of friends here, as most have moved away over the last few years. Social media has a way of making you realize this on a daily basis. Instagram though, I can't seen to quit it. Read a few Money Diaries and then get back to work. 

12:30 pm - Eat lunch while working. I'm not going to take an actual break since I plan on leaving at 4:15 tonight. 

4:15 pm - Leave and drive home to pick up M. We then turn around and go into downtown and park next to the theater. $12. We go and meet A and her daughter L (who is 16) for dinner. Eat a ton of pretty decent Indian food at Little India. It's not where I'll go with S on Friday night but it hits the spot. A treats since I bought tickets for this show. M & L have a shared love of musicals, so we've been seeing 3-4 a year for the past few years. We tend to take turns buying the tickets for shows/dinner. Tonight we're seeing Miss Saigon, but we've also seen Anastasia, Wicked and Dear Evan Hansen over the past year. $12

7:15 pm - Go find our seats at the Buell. Miss Saigon was great, although I liked Anastasia so much more. We saw that one in August. At the mid way point I buy M & I both a juice. $9

10:40 pm - Get home and head to bed. Get a call from S at 11:10 pm who is super upset and I end up inviting her over. She lost a baby at work tonight (she's a NICU nurse) and she ends up basically crying on me until she falls asleep. 

Total: $154.89

  
**Day four - Thursday:** 

5:54 am - Wake up to S leaving my room. She is working this morning and has to be there by 7am. I tell her that M is camping the next two nights with friends and if she wants to come stay over, she can come by after work. She says she'd love to stay tonight, but warns me it'll be after 7pm. 

With that happy thought of two more nights of S in my bed, I let myself snooze for an hour and then get up and get ready for work. Even without sex, having her here last night was good. I'm glad I was able to be comforting in a horrible moment. Am pretty sure I'm falling hard for this woman. Casual doesn't seem to be working out this time. Whoops.

7:30 am - Wake up the kid before I go to work. Squish her for a bit in her bed before leaving and reminding her to call me when she gets where she's going this afternoon. There are five of them going camping and it's only four hours from here, but I'll worry until she's home Saturday. She says she heard S crying last night and I apologize for that. I explain why and she understands. She'd be fine with S being here more, I'm the nervous one. I'm reminded again that my kid is much more put together than I am emotionally.

Pack up breakfast, but I'm out of chili, so I'll be buying lunch today. Get Starbucks and head to work. $4.89

9:00 am - Eat my breakfast and make a playlist on Spotify called kitchen dancing. Got to plan ahead. Ahem. Also add a few more songs to my driving playlist for this weekend. 

11:00 am - Take a quick break and look up the blue book on M's car and contemplate the pain of selling it. I will sell it, but I'll likely wait until after the holidays, as she'll be home for a month and I very much enjoy not sharing my car. 

Noon: Go out and get lunch with A. We grab salads at Mad Greens and chat. Her oldest kid is 16 so she's a year behind me on these big changes. We discuss me basically being alone after next week and how I'll deal. (Honestly, I have no idea.) For whatever reason I don't mention S being over last night or tonight. Sometimes A gets a bit pushy and while in some ways I appreciate it (kind of like having a big sister), this time I just want to be where I am without comment. $11.26

3:30 pm - Get a mama I'm alive with photo proof text from M. Smile and text her back a selfie with a big thumbs up. I'm lame and cool with it.

4:00 pm: Get a text from S that she's leaving work a bit early, because they have extra nurses and she's already worked four shifts this week and will be at my house at 6pm.

4:45 pm - Leave work and stop and get some salmon, bread and tiramisu at Whole Foods and head home. Change clothes and chop up veggies to roast while I wait for S. Realize this is the first I've cooked all week. Is this what kid in college life will look like? Not sure how I feel about it. $32.26

6ish pm - S shows up and we hang out and make out for a bit on my couch and talk about our days. She has her kids week on and week off, so next week she'll have them when I'm gone. We discuss her coming over a lot the following week, which makes me giddy. I eventually drag myself out of her arms to make us some dinner, since I'm starving. Salad for lunch really doesn't last long. While I cook, we have a where are we in this relationship talk and sorta decide to not fully go there right now.   Decide this conversation needs wine and open a bottle of red. I tell her that I came from a really messed up childhood and I struggle with relationships, but I'm very much enjoying this one with her. Her marriage was ten years long and she's very okay with where we currently are right now.   Basically getting on the same page of, lets have fun and discuss it later. (This is a theme that isn't getting me far right now.)

I roast zucchini and brussel sprouts and cook salmon and cheese bread. I attempt to clean up my kitchen but end up otherwise occupied and well, yeah. At some point I remember we have dessert and we have that in bed.

  
Total: $48.41

  
**Day five - Friday**

6:32 am. - UGHHHHHH. Thank god it's Friday is all I can say. Waking up next to a beautiful woman doesn't hurt anything either. Cuddle with S for half an hour and then I get up to get ready. S goes back to sleep (she's off today) and I shower and get ready. I leave her a note to stay as long as she wants. We already made our plans for tonight so I'll see her then.

7:30 am -  Leave the house and get a call right away from my best friend E. She's up early with her toddlers (it's 6:30 where she is) and we chat the rest of my way to work. I gush about S and she tells me she's surprise pregnant and to the moon thrilled about it. I'm so glad I'll be around them next year. I tell E that I'll be sad to leave S next year and she reminds me to chill, that anything can happen. To not worry about the probable heartbreak a year in advance when I can just enjoy the fun. My best friend is wise and I miss her fiercely. We also discuss next week and our beach trip. M and I are driving to CA on Sunday/Monday and then going to Santa Cruz with E and her family for a few days before college drop off. E brings up drop off and how I'm feeling about it and I make her stop so I don't cry. Tell her it's a conversation for next week. 

On my way to work I did get my usual iced latte. $4.89

9:30 am - Remember to eat breakfast eventually. The usual, cereal and banana. 

10:00 am - S texts and asks if she can bring me lunch. YES. Realize I'm basically out of work, which doesn't matter since I'm gone for a week and a half. Spend time online putzing around.

Noon: - Go outside our building and S drives by to pick me up. We go to a nearby park and have a picnic with sandwiches she picked up. Mostly we talk about vacations and places we'd like to see if money was no option. Take an hour lunch but when I get back, no one even realized I was gone. Attempt to concentrate for the remainder of the work day, even though I have absolutely no motivation. 

4:30 pm - Put an out of office message on my email/phone and say goodbye to A and my boss. FREEEEEEEEEEDOOOOMMM. This job has been good to me and supported M and I well for twelve years, but I'll be very happy to move on next year.   
Head home and manage to get to my house right as S does. We have 6pm dinner reservations but go have some quick fun in my room before getting ready to go. 

6:00 pm - Go to a fantastic family run Indian restaurant and order all kinds of tasty things. I'd write it out but I'm honestly unsure how to spell it all. I treat, as it was my date idea. $110 with tip. 

After dinner we decide to go walk around the downtown area in our town. It's not downtown Denver, more like downtown suburb, but it's all lit up and it's pleasant outside. We wander around and look in a few shops, get some fudgey ice cream goodness which we share (S pays) and contemplate going to a movie. In the end we decide we'd rather watch a movie on my couch so we head home. 

On the way back to my house we talk about her boys (eight year old twins) and how she thinks she'd like me to meet them soon. I tell her I'd really like her to meet M before she heads to school and maybe she could come have dinner with us tomorrow night. She tells me that'd be four nights in a row and wants to make sure I'm truly okay with it. I say yes, I am. Scared as can be, but still happy with the idea. We end up laying on my trampoline for a bit discussing why I'm such a disaster at this. We also discuss spending time at her house the week after next. We've spent more time here, but it's just happened that way. After an hour or so of chatting and fooling around on the trampoline, we head in to bed. 

Total: $114.89

**Day six - Saturday:**  
No alarm! I wake up around 8:20. Hang out in bed with S until 10 ish when the need for coffee takes over and we get up. We decide to go to brunch. We both get avocado toast and eggs and the nectar of the gods, coffee. S pays. 

11:10 am - I kiss S goodbye at her car for 20 minutes and then she eventually leaves to go do things at her house. I shower and then clean my kitchen and bathroom and start laundry. M has been pulling her stuff out to pack all week and my living room looks like her bedroom exploded all over it. I attempt to start organizing it all. I open up the Amazon box from the other day and am confused by the assortment of things. M's purse and boots, but also swim ear plugs, four bottles of body wash and candy. Please tell me I'm not the only one who leaves random things in their shopping cart? Every time we order it's a toss up on what will show up. That's also why it was more money than I thought M had told me. 

2:20 pm - M gets home and we continue to pack/clean/organize all the things. I tell her I invited S over for dinner and she says she's glad, but can we get Pho. Yes. I'll take easy dinner right now. Then I won't need to re-clean my kitchen. We take a break around 5pm after getting a good amount of stuff in my car and sit on the couch looking at dogs together on her iPad. We lost our pit bull/lab mix (Hazel) back in April and we're both still heartbroken. She was the only animal I've ever owned and we picked her out together when M turned four. She was a queen among dogs. I'm not ready for another dog yet, but it's fun to look. M tells me I need a dog so I'm not too lonely without her and I laugh at her comparing herself in my life to a puppy. Silly child, it's not even close to the same thing. 

6:00 pm - S gets to the house and I officially introduce her to M. They've waved at each other a few times in the comings and goings, but not officially hung out at all. We leave to go get Pho from a little place close to my house. We spend the entire dinner discussing musicals and what we thought of all that we've seen. S is in the same boat as us, in not having managed to get Hamilton tickets last fall and we discuss how unfair it was that they only came for two weeks. I remind them both that it'll be here next fall for two months. It makes me nervous, this dinner, but it's also easy and delightful and I shouldn't have worried about S meeting M. We get noodle bowls and bobas. I pay. $69 with tip.

8:00 pm - I pull M aside and ask her if she'll be okay if S stays the night. She has no issue with it and suggests we all watch a movie together. I let her pick and we end up watching Beauty and the Beast. I laugh, because this is probably her favorite musical movie and the cartoon version was her favorite when she was a toddler. We make popcorn and M finds candy in her room (I swear to you the girl always has candy on her person) and shares it. Life is better with skittles and jelly beans. We have a good evening before all heading to bed around 11pm. M and I leave early in the morning. 

Total: $69.00

  
**Day seven - Sunday**

5:25 am - Noooooooooo. Sigh. My alarm goes off and I apologize to S who wakes up too. I'd like to stay cuddled up with this warm beautiful lady, but instead I force myself up. S gets up as well and we pull ourselves together. M is already up and dressed. I do believe my baby is excited about this phase in her life. Or she never went to bed. Possibly both. I walk S to her car and tell her I'll talk to her soon. 

6:00 am - M and I get out of the house and drive right to the Starbucks. We get coffee and egg bites. $20 ish dollars. Sorry, I have the app and it reloads itself with $100 from my credit card when it gets below $10 and I use it every day, but I've been also aware that it is money spent, so I've just been treating it as cash. I go next door for gas and fill up my car. $36.89

We put on my road trip playlist that I've been working on for weeks and get on the road. After eating, M is fast asleep in ten minutes which I knew would happen.  
This is where I fail at this weekly journal. We drove all day and stopped a billion times. Made it to Elko, Nevada, because I don't like staying in small Utah towns. Hotel was $109 but I did a crap job of keeping track of gas/food. Sorry. I'll add in another $125 for meals + gas and call it good. It was probably around there anyway.

Total: $290.89

**Weekly total: $706.60**

This week was weird, just plain weird. Expensive too, but I knew it would be. (It's good I didn't do this for my holiday week, holy crap my credit card is burning.) Normally I cook two-three times a week and we eat leftovers/easy dinners the rest of the time. Normally I go to the rec center a few times a week and spend more time reading than watching TV. That said, life is crazy right now and I sorta go with the flow where money is concerned. I'm decent at savings most months. I've re-read this a half dozen times and considered taking out all of the personal story type stuff and I've decided to leave it. If you read all of that, you are my hero.","# About me

# How I got here (my family money story)

**Great-great grandparents:**

Slaves 

**Great-grandparents:** 

Escaped sharecropping and relocated to California for better opportunities than those available to black ppl in the South. Did not finish high school 

**Grandparents:** 

My dad's mom worked as a housekeeper and caretaker into her late seventies and was known as a penny pincher. My grandpa worked as a school janitor. They were able to buy some properties and make rental income. When they died, they left my dad and his siblings a small trust.

Don’t know anything about my mom's dad. My grandma was that first in her family to graduate high school and she worked as a nurse. She viewed educational achievement as a told for social mobility and instilled these values into her kids.

**Parents:** 

My dad was the first in his family to attend college. He dropped out and worked in a cannery for a while before getting an accounting job (this was the 80s okay), and world for the state. He is a saver like his mom and values stability and taking care of business.

My mom was the first in her family to graduate college. She works as a teacher. And she taught me to follow my passions and to value curiosity and intellectualism over making money. She’s a spender.

**Me:** (TLDR — I benefited greatly from an exceptional education)

Honestly, there is very little I did to land in my current position. I benefited greatly from the opportunities available to blacks out West as compared to in the South, which allowed my grandparents and parents to experience upward mobility through modest real estate investment and education. 

For me, education and a curious spirit have really opened doors. While my mom went back to school for a second degree, a professor recommended getting me enrolled at a stupidly expensive private school nearby. The school was know for cultivating an inquisitiveness in each child and encouraging them creatively—it was also over 20K/year for lower school (for context, my family’s household income at the time was around 50K/year). I attended  on scholarship through fifth grade, and was nurtured greatly there. After, I continued on to a cheaper Catholic school for middle and high school (By this point my mom was working and my dad picked up side jobs to pay tuition). My parents used all of their disposable income on paying for my and my siblings’ education and I’m beyond grateful. 

I then attended top 10 schools for undergrad and my masters, which gave me the luxury to use those years to learn what I wanted—what makes my brain tick—rather than focusing on a career path. I had no idea what I wanted to do either after undergrad of grad school, but I knew that the names of my schools and their networks carried enough social capital to get my foot in the door.

I got my first job in UI because my academic background/publications/passion was compelling to the hiring manager. Same with my current employer (a large tech company). 

A note about student debt: I often in these forums see people discourage young people from taking on debt, but in my experience, debt buys you time. For me, I was able to focus on my studies rather than stressing about bills, and it’s paid off.

# Money Diary 

    Day 1: Thursday | Daily total: $0.00

&#x200B;

    Day 2: Friday | Daily total: $109.93

11:30 am — My partner, B, lives alone, so we decided to quarantine at their place since the beginning of March\*. I realize that we only have groceries for two more nights of dinner, so I open NYT cooking on Instagram to find something that catches my eye. During these quarantimes, I’ve found cooking to be soothing, and I finally made something that B liked the other day. I’ve been liking Alison Roman’s Spicy and Saucy Cherry Tomato pasta, and go with one of her other recipes this time: Caramelized Shallot Pasta. I pop open my Prime Now app and get the ingredients plus some bananas, leafy greens and this Sweet Bourbon salmon I’ve been loving. It comes to 48.33 + a $5 tip. (**$55.33**)

7:14 pm — It’s still light out, so B and I decide to get out the house to find a drive through for iced coffee. We preorder so it’s ready as soon as we arrive. (**$5.86**)

8:10 pm — We’ve been supporting local restaurants we love one day a week, and I pick an Asian fusion spot that we haven’t had in a while. I order two rice bowls with chili peanuts and avocado on the side. It’s delicious. (**$48.74**)

*\*B and I live across the country from each other and are doing the good old LDR. I was visiting them in Feb when my job told everyone to work from home—so I’ve stayed put. My roommate has been living with their family for the past two months.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

    Day 3: Saturday | Daily total: $78.70

4:46 pm — I’ve spent most of the day lounging after a pretty stressful work week. I really really enjoyed the food we ordered last night, so I decide to go for it again (ha!). I add on a curry rice bowl that I haven’t tried before in addition to our usual order. With delivery and tip, it comes out to 73.32. (**$73.32**)

8:10 pm —  We drive to a nearby trail and do a quick run, and then make a quick Dunkin’ run and split a large iced coffee with whipped cream. By split, I mean I take little sips bc I’m not a huge coffee drinker and B is. (**$5.38**)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

    Day 4: Sunday | Daily total: $82.77

11:00 am — B and I hit the trail early in the morning and do a walk/run for a while, enjoying getting out of the city. While we walk I start up an episode of United States of Anxiety. I recently discovered it and, I'm hooked (I went all the way back to season one)! This episode is about the culture war between rights and religion. 

12:50 pm — As we make it back to our part of town, we pass by a local restaurant that is open for brunch. B places and pickup order for coffee at Starbucks, and I whip our my Caviar app to place a pick up order at the restaurant. I get a breakfast sandwich for B, a veggie hash for myself and latkes to share. (**$38.00**)

4:00 pm — I get a sweet tooth. Since staying at home, I’ve been making a weekly dessert, so I decide to go with fruit pizza—that’s a shortbread or sugar cookie crust topped with marscapone and delicious fresh fruit. I decide to top it with blueberries, strawberries and kiwi. I add these items to my cart for delivery, along with a few other staples. (**$44.77**)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

    Day 5: Monday | Daily total: $0.00

2:00 pm — We’ve basically devoured the entire fruit pizza 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

    Day 6: Tuesday | Daily total: $0.00

&#x200B;

    Day 7: Wednesday | Daily total: $0.00

I realized this money diary was basically a food diary. During quarantimes, most of spending has been on food (mainly groceries), so it wasn’t surprising that that was the only category I spent in. All in all this was a pretty normal weekly total spend for me, but usually my purchases are more varied. I ate out way more than I normally do, but I was nice to get a break from cooking for a bit. I’d be interested to see if this Covid19 will change my spending even after stay at home orders are lifted.

I was a little stressed from work this past week, and finding it more difficult than I anticipated to draw boundaries around my working time. 

And I've been thinking about how to support essential workers while lessening our impact on them during this time. If anyone has ideas, I'd love to hear.","More of a thought exercise than a question, but which celebrity/influencer would you most want to see a money diary for?

For me: it has to be Caroline Calloway. I am so baffled by her income/spending ratio, and I want to know what percent of her money is family inheritance vs scam income vs credit card debt. The numbers just do not add up!

I also would love to see Nicole Cliffe's because she spends an insane amount on haunted jewelry and novelty t-shirts but also has three kids, is a good writer, is amazingly generous, and I think it would be really entertaining without being a total hot mess like Caroline's.","Now that we're (give or take) a month into this thing, I'm curious how the things bought in preparation for our new collective lifestyle have worked out for you. I know that not everyone is able to be at home or financially secure enough to have bought random shit in preparation for a global pandemic. But if you did, are you baking, or do you just have a 20 lb bag of flour sitting in your hall closet? Are your new dumbbells used daily or as doorstops? 

Here are mine:

**Regrets**

* Oatmeal? Why do I compulsively buy oatmeal in times of stress? I have a box of those little single serve packets at work for an emergency snack that I don't think I've even opened. Every backpacking trip I've ever been on I've thrown a couple packets in my bag and never touched them. And when I did my first big grocery shop in anticipation of staying at home of course I purchased three different flavours! Clearly this is not my snack of choice. Why am I like this??
* Embroidery kit. When all this started everyone on Instagram was talking about all the new hobbies they were taking up with all their free time and I had a vision of myself in a glamorous robe staring wistfully out the window embroidering. The thing is, I really don't think I have that much more free time? I am (gratefully) continuing to work remotely and (begrudgingly) pushing through the final stages of my [M.Sc](https://M.Sc). I'm trying to work out every day. My partner is home more, demanding attention. I maybe saved an hour a day that I was spending commuting and I think I just spend it lying on the couch browsing Reddit. I don't like oatmeal nor do I prioritize crafting apparently.

**Wins**

* Garden supplies! One thing I have made time for is starting seeds and getting a little container garden going. I'm very fortunate to have outdoor space where we live, and our little garden has given me a fleeting sense of control in this world. No matter what happens we will have kale!
* A bird feeder! I got a relatively inexpensive bird feeder from Amazon and hung it right outside the window of my home office. We've gotten an impressive range of birds and its makes me feel connected to nature when we've cancelled all our camping trips and less lonely when my essential worker partner is away.","Temporarily laid off until business picks up again. Thankfully I have savings and family to fall back on, but I know many others are not so lucky. My condolences to everyone who is facing tough financial times right now!","I’m notoriously horrible with money. Like, I’m the worst at saving, budgeting, and overall not buying dumb crap.

I’m looking for advice on how to get ahead and save etc. I love this sub for its non-judgmental vibe so I felt more comfortable asking you guys than the other finance subs. 

Do you use spreadsheets, apps, programs to keep a budget of everything? How do you guys keep your finances under control? I’m so bad with money I’m afraid I’ll get even worse having more of it. 

Thanks everyone :)


Edit: in NYC","Hey everybody!

In a few days this sub will be turning one years old (tearing up like a proud mama just thinking about it ha ha), What should we do to celebrate?  u/intventorofHLB suggested a discussion of ""top things people have learned / changed from this sub"" in a previous post which sounds awesome. What else do people have in mind?","Hi all-

I’m a longtime lurker and sometimes commenter whose been around this sub since the very early days, and it is definitely my fave reddit community. My nuclear family- my hubby, toddler, and I are COVID positive. I know I had a ton of questions and other people have a ton of questions and there are a lot of scary stories out there while actual information can be hard to find. We want to try and be a resource where we can- so I figured I’d offer to answer any questions if people in this sub have them. I am definitely not a medical professional, and will only speak to our experience or direct to resources I’ve found helpful.

A little background: We had been social distancing per CDC guidelines, only grocery shopping when needed and having my husband continuing to report to work as necessary. My husband is a federal law enforcement officer working in a high risk environment. He developed some minor symptoms while off work for a short stretch. Because of the high risk nature of his job, we decided to get a test out of caution. He got a confirmed diagnosis 24 hours later. Since then, we’ve both been symptomatic (mostly mildly), along with our toddler. This means we’re both assumed positive as well. We’ve been able to manage our health at home- and while we certainly haven’t felt awesome, we’re also extremely lucky to have a relatively mild case of this. 

We are both currently employed full time, and I’ve been working from home since mid March. We were both given leave from work while we recover- I took about a week of paid admin leave and am back to working remotely. My husband has to take closer to two weeks of PTO, and go three days symptom free, before he can report back to work. He will likely head back next week. We are super lucky for understanding and supportive employers, and full time employment to return to. I would say his job security is guaranteed while my continued employment is likely but not definite. 

The biggest financial implications for us have been rapidly developing an emergency plan, financial and otherwise, if one or any combination of us had to be hospitalized or on unpaid leave from work longterm, and daycare closures and childcare arrangements for our 15 month old.

So if you’ve got any questions, I’ll be lurking and happy to answer! Hope everyone is staying healthy and happy and home.","Hello, this is my first MD ever but I’ve been writing them in my head for a long time (complete with references to sexy times with my SO, humblebragging about my egg white and quinoa breakfasts, and skipping my $100 spin classes--jk I don’t do any of that) so I figured I might as well get roasted for my finances for real.

**Basic Info:**

Age: 26

Gender: Female

Location: New York City

Industry: Publishing

Occupation: Assistant

**Section 1 - Debts and Assets**

Student Loan Balance: $0 (I had a scholarship that covered room and board and we used credit cards to cover the rest. My mother is undocumented and at the time I was in college, my sister was a DACA recipient so I didn’t have anyone to co-sign a loan.

Other debt: $0

**Section 2 - Income**

Monthly take home after taxes, etc: $2,500 (I am an assistant who works in publishing; would rather not get specific in exactly which area. But if you have questions about the industry, I can answer what I know in the comments or via PMs.)

**Section 3 - Monthly Expenses**

Rent: $1,600 (I am subletting a 1-bedroom apartment in upper upper Manhattan. When it ends, I hope to join the lease. My boyfriend Pierre\* and I are getting serious and while we’re not ready to live together, we did want more privacy to test the waters. Also, I love living alone.)

* Netflix: $15.99/month (I share the password with Lily and her friend, who gave me $100 at the beginning of the year to cover her share for 2 years)
* Other: $0.99/month donation to the Texas Monthly Observer, $10/month donation to The Guardian, $30/month to ex-roommates in exchange for the cable/HBO password (It’s cheaper than me getting my own cable), $25/year for Barnes &amp; Noble membership (I just signed up for this since I run a book club and members get discounts on purchases)

\*=Fake name. I hate the ""My friends A, B, C,"" thing.

**Day 1: 11/25**

8:00am - Wake up and hit the snooze. I was up until 12:30 am baking keto chocolate zucchini bread that would just not bake all the way through.

8:15am - Finally get out of bed and start my morning routine. Skincare: Rhoto Hada Labo Gokyujyun foaming facial wash, Dr. Thayer’s Witch Hazel Toner, followed by Herbivore Prism Glow Potion, Cetaphil Pro Oily Skin with SPF 30. No make up. Cocoa butter lotion for the body.

With a non-stick frying pan, I fry up turkey bologna and scrambled eggs. I also eat a soggy banana that’s on the verge of turning completely black. I pack a lunch (tomato soup) and head out the door.  I was hoping to get to work early, which will happen, but not as early as I would have liked. I was out of the office on Friday attending a local conference so I need to catch up on things.

9:30am - On the train to work and I text with Lily to discuss my mom's recent  decision to move to Mexico. She lives in a pro-Trump state and as an undocumented person, it’s becoming increasingly difficult for her to fly under the radar. She’s fearful of being detained by ICE and so she’s going back on her own terms. I tell Lily that I feel like Trump won. He succeeded in building a culture of fear and intimidation. Lily tells me that with or without Trump in office, it is likely that Mom would have had to return to Mexico while we applied for her residency anyway (Lily is now married to a US citizen and has a green card). This doesn’t make me feel better and I want to cry.

9:46am - Arrive at the office 15 minutes early and get a head start on answering emails. Lily once asked me what I do all day and honestly, it’s a bunch of emailing. Emailing publishers to ask about status updates about deals, emailing clients to let them know about said status updates, emailing to chase after information I need on behalf of publishers or clients, responding to submissions, etc. Just emails, emails, emails.

1:21pm - Lily texts me a screenshot from an article about cheap living costs in Cancun. She jokes, “Why aren’t we moving with Mom too?” I text back that when Mom moves to Mexico, we should go with her to look at potential properties for her to buy so she isn’t renting indefinitely. I feel like crying again. I type up my expense report from the conference to distract myself. I don’t have a company card so I get reimbursed for using my personal card when I travel. The conference paid for my hotel and train so I just get reimbursed for my meals.

1:35pm - Lily texts me that we should set up a savings account that we can contribute to for Mom’s living expenses in Mexico. I admire my sister’s practicality in all of this, but I am not emotionally equipped to deal with this stuff when I am at work!!!!!!!!!!

1:54pm - I heat up my tomato soup while my boss writes my reimbursement check. I take my lunch to eat outside and I buy a bag of salt and vinegar chips from Pret a Manger to go with my soup ($1.69). After I eat, I go check out the holiday shops at Bryant Park and treat myself to a “giant s’more” ($8.17). The s’more is the size of my hand which makes me feel slightly better about the expense. I text Pierre about how sad I feel and go back to the office. I take the stairs instead of the elevator so I burn off some of the empty calories I just consumed. - **$9.86**

3:48pm - Pierre texts me his sympathies and sends me a Baby Yoda meme to cheer me up. Goddamn, I love him so much. And Pierre’s great too.

6:06pm - Finally done with work! I’m halfway to the train station when I realize I forgot my gym bag at work. I double back and while on the train, I eat a pre-workout snack of string mozzarella cheese and a baggie of roasted peanuts that I packed from home.

7:15pm - I do a 1 hour workout on the treadmill--30 mins of interval running and then 30 min incline workout, plus a cool down--but I feel sluggish and slow. Must be the s’more. Or maybe I’m still thinking about my mom.

8:40pm- Back at home! I shower and then eat some of the zucchini bread and a Greek yogurt for dinner. Too tired to cook a real meal. I call my mom and we talk more about moving plans. She plans to buy a home in a touristy area and rent part of it out. When I go home for Christmas, we’ll have to start cleaning the house out. Luckily, Lily lives near our Mom and will be able to store important family mementos.

Our plans sound cheerful but the way we talk reminds me of that same dejected feeling we had in 2016 when she came to visit me, post-Trump election. “Paciencia, fey, y fuerza,” is what we agreed to carry through the next four years. But it feels like we’ve run out.

While I’m on gloomy matters, I pay my bills. $1600 for rent, $65.03 for the electric bill, and $150 payment for each credit card. I deposit my reimbursement check and a $10 check I received from the Pew Research Center. I’ve recently been selected to be part of the Pew Research surveys and this is this first survey that I have been paid for, but I don’t know how often I will receive them. - **$1,965.03, +$40.**

I spend the rest of my evening setting up this Money Diary and watching 90 Day Fiance: The Other Way. The Jenny/Sumit drama is insane.

11:41pm - Finally got my MD set up and turn in. Nighttime skin routine: Vitamin C serum on neck and face; Estee Lauder Night Repair Creme on my eyes. I don't think it's really working but I want to finish the bottle before I try a new eye cream.

**Day 2: 11/26**

8:00am - Wake up and hit the snooze. Not as tired as yesterday but still want to stay in bed. Pierre texts me to wish him luck on his annual review. I text him back and then get distracted checking Reddit on my phone.

8:30am - Whoops. How did a half hour go by so quickly? I get out of bed, do my skincare routine, get dressed, etc. I eat a bowl of Special K for breakfast and pack my lunch (turkey bologna sandwich on a plain bagel, Ruffle chips, mozzarella cheese stick, 3 clementines, and a half-empty Coke zero that I bought over the weekend). I am an elementary school child.

9:10am - Catch the train and listen to Slate’s Dear Prudence podcast. In this episode, a LW complains about her friend, who whipped out her Macbook to finish writing a term paper in the middle of the LW’s wedding ceremony. The LW claims you can hear the click-clacking of typing in the wedding video and the friend even took a Skype call in the middle of the ceremony to chat with a study buddy (which you can also hear in the wedding video!). I am horrified.

9:42am - Arrive at the office and I’m the first one here. Half of our office, including my boss, took vacation days to get a head start on the holiday. This means I can listen to podcasts while I work since no one will really need me throughout the day.

I check my personal email before I look at work stuff and find an email from my bank, announcing that there was a “recent merchant data breach” and while my account wasn’t compromised, they’re going to send a new credit card which means I will have to update the information for my recurring payments. Great.

Okay, back to work. I grab a fun-size Snickers bar from the communal candy bowl for a mid-morning snack and get to work.

12:22pm - Ugh, Special K was not that filling. I drink hot water to help my stomach feel full but I am so hungry. I decided to eat my lunch at my desk even though it’s earlier than I usually eat.

6:45pm - Finally leave work! I stayed late to check my mom into her flight but check-in is based in her time zone, not mine so I could have left earlier. Grr. I text Lily and she promises to check Mom in.

8pm - Pierre and I get home at the same time! We make dinner together: spaghetti with truffle oil along with sauteed onions and kale, plus Trader Joe’s turkey meatballs. I pull out mini bottles of prosecco that I bought for Lily’s visit that went unused. While we cook, I pour out my feelings to Pierre.

I know that we are in a very privileged position: Lily and I can support my mother to have a very comfortable life in Mexico. We can afford to fly out to see her 3, maybe even 4 times a year. My mom will be able to stop living in fear. But there’s just something wrong about us not being in the same country.

Pierre knows a little of what I’m feeling because his mother is back in France and he misses her terribly, especially since she's been sick. (Nothing serious, but he feels bad that he can't be there for her.)

After dinner, we watch *The Mandalorian*. God, I would die for Baby Yoda. Pierre just got into *Dragula* so we watch an episode but I hate the format. It just feels so disorganized, especially compared to *Rupaul’s Drag Race*. Pierre gets squicked out by an elimination challenge featuring needles so we watch *Call the Midwife* so he can calm down. Poor guy.

**Day 3: 11/27**

12 am - Finally, we turn off *Call the Midwife*. I clean up the kitchen while Pierre gets dressed for his overnight shift. (He’s a security guard.) We kiss goodbye and he promises everything is set for him to come to Thanksgiving.

12:40 am - I stay up to finish the *Call the Midwife* episode and then go to bed. I call my mom even though it’s late because I just want to hear her voice. We talk through the airport pick up plans and say good night. I have the day off so I can stay up late.

10 am - Wake up and lay in bed. I text Pierre to ask for good thoughts. I’m super anxious about my mom flying even though she uses her Mexican passport and hasn’t had issues before. After a half hour, I get up to go to the gym and burn off some of my nervous energy. I only eat a mandarin for breakfast.

11:30 am - At the gym. Since I didn’t have a good breakfast, I do a low-intensity incline work out.

12:30 pm - Back at home. I shower and eat the keto zucchini bread for my brunch. I know I should eat more but I’m too anxious. I go to the train station, buy 2 weekly metro cards. One is for my mom and the other is a refill for me. Normally I would get the monthly but since I’m going home for the holidays in 2 weeks, it makes more sense to buy weekly passes. - **$67.00**

1:45 pm - First stop on my errands: Michael’s. I buy supplies to convert an arrowhead earring into necklace for Lily. I use a 40% off coupon so my total is **$5.55**

1:59pm - I buy two rotisserie chickens at Whole Foods for Thanksgiving. I’m not fucking with turkey with my tiny ass oven. - **$16.69**

2:38pm - Buy a half dozen plain bagels at Zabar’s for breakfast. - **$5.60**

3:00pm - I walk to the train station and pass the Macy’s parade balloons being inflated. So cool! Maybe next year I’ll come down to get a better look, but for now I need to get home.

3:35pm - At the farmer’s market near my train stop, I buy 3 lbs of grapes and a stalk of celery. I don't know how long this market is going to stick around but I hope it stays all year round. It's where I can get super cheap produce. I stop at the local grocery store and pick up sparkling cider. - **$12.42**

4:00pm - Finally home! I put away my groceries, prep the Thanksgiving sides, and clean up while I wait for my mom’s flight to land. I finish *90 Day Fiance: Before the 90 Days* and then pick up where I left off on *90 Day Fiance: The Other Way*. I love the 90DF franchise but they’re releasing so many seasons at once that I can’t keep up.

6:08pm - My mom calls that she’s about to board her flight. Hurray! I can finally relax and eat leftover spaghetti before I go to meet her at the airport.

10:33pm - Take public transport to LaGuardia. I find my mom, who made friends with her seat partner on the flight and they exchange numbers so they can get in touch. We pick up her suitcase and I lead her to the rideshare pick up area. We pass a lost-looking couple in their 60s who are trying to figure out where to call an Uber so my mom adopts them. She helps the wife with her suitcase and tells them that I’ll show them where to go. They chatter about Thanksgiving plans on the way. I don’t know how, but my mom always makes friends wherever she goes. When we get to the pick up area, a parking lot attendant helps the couple call an Uber while I call a Lyft for us. - **$41.00, including tip.**

11:46pm - Finally home! I give my mom a quick tour of my apartment. She says it’s nice but I need to clean better. Moms. I’m ready for bed, but she asks me to put on her telenovela so she can unwind. I set her up (she’s watching [Apocalipse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalipse), btw) and leave her on the couch while I go to bed.

**Day 4: 11/28**

8:30am - I wake up but my mom isn’t in bed with me. Evidently, she fell asleep on the couch. She’s an early bird so she has NBC playing, ready for the parade to start. We shower, get dressed, etc.

9:14am - Pierre arrives, having come straight from his overnight shift. He is, understandably, exhausted. He takes a nap in my room while my mom and I watch the parade and prep everything to warm up in the oven. We FaceTime with Lily, who is spending Thanksgiving with her neighbors.

12:28pm - Food is ready just as Pierre’s sister, Colette\*, arrives. I'm serving rotisserie chicken, macaroni and cheese, mashed potatoes, roasted veggies, and cornbread dressing. I wake up Pierre and I put on the Fleetwood Mac radio station on Spotify to listen to as we eat. It’s a nice time just eating our fill and talking. Pierre and I are discussing marriage and it’s nice to imagine that this will be what holidays will be like when our families combine. My mom says she likes Pierre but she seems lukewarm. Lily tells me that's exactly how she was like with her husband and now adores him as a son in law. I hope we'll have other opportunities for her to get to know Pierre.

3:00pm - We are done eating and put away the leftovers. I give some to Colette to take with her while Pierre gets ready to go back to work. Yep, he has to work again. I think Pierre’s job takes advantage of his eager to please nature and I tell him so, but he says he can handle it. Plus, he gets holiday pay. Colette also leaves and my mom and I take a short food coma nap.

4:48pm - We bundle up and head out to see the window displays at Saks Fifth Avenue and Macy’s. My mom is annoyed that so many shops are open. She complains that back home, Thanksgiving plans revolve around the football games and here, everything revolves around shopping. Still, we go into Macy’s to look for my birthday gift and take advantage of their “pre-Black Friday” sale. We find a BCBG genuine leather jacket for 50% off. The sales clerk says it’s the last one and it just so happens to fit me perfectly. My mom uses her Macy’s card to pay for it. I thank her for the birthday gift.

7:50pm - We stop to buy Palmolive dish soap at CVS. I’m running low at soap at home and my mom says my Trader Joe’s branded soap is not up to the task of handling Thanksgiving dishes. - **$2.49**

8:59pm - I take my mom to The View, the revolving restaurant within the Times Square Marriott. I get a margarita and she gets a non-alcoholic Apple Pie. We talk more about her upcoming move and I tell my mom my complicated feelings about it. She tells me that this is a good thing and Trump isn’t winning here. “I raised two daughters who are both great successes and now I’m going to retire and live my life. We won, not him,” she says. - **$56.98**

10:00pm - Back home! I shower and go to bed. My mom stays up to watch her telenovela.

**Day 5: 11/29**

10:00 am - Wake up and get ready to go. Mom fell asleep on the couch again. At this rate, I might as well just make her a bed out there. She insists that she’s fine. Anyway, today is all about my mom. I take her shoe shopping at a mom and pop store on the Upper East Side store that carries SAS shoes, her favorite brand. My mom is very picky and only finds one pair that she likes in her size. And it's on sale! - **$20.00**

12:49pm - I take my mom to El Museo del Barrio. El Museo is in partnership with The City Museum of New York next door so once we’re done with El Museo, we go next door and don’t have to pay a second admission fee. - **$18.00**

2:40pm - I take my mom to Grand Central Station to admire the main hall and we eat lunch in the food court. I order ramen and chicken dumplings for the both of us. - **$33.57**

3:30pm - I take my mom to oo35mm, my favorite beauty supply shop in Chinatown. I buy a bottle of facial wash for myself and convince my mom let me buy her an anti-wrinkle cream, a hair mask, and a pair of sheet masks for us. My mom is skeptical (she’s an Estée Lauder and Clinique gal) but I swear to her that the sales clerks know what they’re talking about in their recommendations. She does admit that my skin has cleared up a lot this past year so she agrees to let me buy the products for her. - **$60.92**

5:40pm - We walk to Little Italy and have a light dinner at a touristy restaurant that has a really good Napoleon. Maybe there still is good Italian food in Little Italy. - **$35.06**

8:00pm - We go see Ain’t Too Proud to Beg, the Broadway musical based on lives of The Temptations. (I bought tickets last week on Today Tix). My mom likes the show but while I agree that the singing and dancing is spectacular, the acting was bland. Also, no one said [“Ain’t nobody coming to see you, Otis!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wNj3xSMEUM)” so that was disappointing.

11:00pm - Back at home and we gotta go to bed because we’re going to Philadelphia in the morning!

Day 6: 11/30

7:00 am - Wake up! This time, I waited until I heard my mom snoring on the couch and then gently roused her to get a night’s rest on an actual bed. We eat a light breakfast and head to Penn station.

11:30am - Arrive in Philly! I bought Amtrak tickets a week ago to return at 10pm but my mom thinks that’s too late so she asks me to change them for an earlier time. - **$44.00**

11:46 am - We leave the station by walking and head towards City Hall and Dilworth Park. I need caffeine so we stop at Starbucks. - **$4.67**

12:00pm - The holiday shops at Dilworth Park and Love Park are amazing! I find an artist who has this adorable cat print that would be the perfect Christmas present for Colette. I find the artist's Etsy page and see that she's going to be at the holiday markets in NYC. I vow to check out her booth there too even though my mom tells me to stop spending my money. Well, Mom, tell the lady to stop making cute stuff! - **$36.47**

1:30pm - We are both hungry so we go to Reading Terminal Market and get lunch. Mom orders a Philly cheesesteak and I get a tortellini pasta salad and kale juice. - **$25.34**

2:30pm - We take the PHLASH bus to do a loop around the sights. We see the Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul, go up the Rocky Steps at the Philadelphia Art Museum, and then head to Old City to see the Betsy Ross House. Mom pays admission for the Betsy Ross House and I pay for our PHLASH fare. - **$10.00**

6:00pm - We are both tired and are ready to head home but still have a couple of hours at the station until our train. We still have leftovers from lunch so we finish those off and my mom buys herself a coffee and donut from Dunkin’. (She won't let me pay for it.) She lets me have a bite of the donut. While we wait, I pull up the Hulu documentary *Tiny Shoulders: Rethinking Barbie* on my phone for the both of us to watch.

10:30pm - Finally back home! Shower, get ready for bed, wait until I hear my mom fall asleep watching TV and then wake her up to come to bed.

**Day 7: 12/1**

9:30 am - Wake up! It’s my mom’s last day in NYC. I ask her what she wants to do. She says that she wants to do my laundry and scrub my bathtub. Moms.

We get dressed and eat a light breakfast. Then we attend Sunday service at my church. The sermon topic uses the recent climate change disasters as a jumping off point to discuss how climate change detrimentally affects the poor and marginalized and what our Christian duty is to help each other and the planet. My mom likes my church’s liberal, social justice oriented focus. She tells me that I should be a more active member and I am trying, but socializing with new people doesn’t come as easily to me as it does to her. Still, when one of the deacons asks me to read a passage from the Bible next week, I agree. Also, I donate $10 to the offering plate. - **$10.00**

2:00pm - After church, I take my mom to the Staten Island ferry so she can see the Statue of Liberty. My mom is impressed that we can get such a good view for free. Pierre texts me that he can meet us when he gets off at work at 4pm so I suggest we have an early dinner at my place before my mom goes to the airport.

2:34pm - After we get back to Manhattan, we take a bus to visit a church that was featured in *The Devil’s Advocate* (the 1997 movie with Keanu Reeves and Al Pacino) but the doors are locked. They must have locked up after morning mass. I feel bad because my mom loves old churches and she was really hoping to see what the interior looked like. The rain is starting to come down so I check my mom’s flight and see it’s been pushed back to 10pm.

3:00pm - On the way home, we stop by Trader Joe’s and pick up fixings to help transform the Thanksgiving leftovers into a new meal. We get milk, sandwich bread, almonds, grape tomatoes, mandarin oranges, green grapes, and cereal bars. The plan is to make grilled cheese sandwiches and kale chicken salad. - **$25.73**

5:00pm - We’re back at home but Pierre has bad news. Towards the end of his shift, he noticed something suspicious on the CCTV and when they went to investigate, they found someone died in the building. He’s still stuck at work answering questions from the NYPD and his company and doesn’t know when he’ll get out. He sends his regards to my mom and tells her “Bon voyage!” Mom and I make dinner for ourselves and when I check her flight again, it’s back to its original departure time of 8pm. Shit! We rush to get everything ready and then I call the Lyft. In the car, I check the flight again and it’s been pushed back to 10pm. What the hell? - **$30.86, including tip.**

6:30pm - Mom and I are at the airport and are super confused. The boards still say her flight leaves at 8pm but my flight tracker says it’s been pushed. My mom doesn’t want to miss it so she decides to go ahead and go through security. We say goodbye and I wait until she passes through before taking public transport home.

8:30pm - Finally back home! I’m super exhausted and clean up a little. My mom calls and reports that her flight got moved to 9pm. The winter storm is coming in so I think flights are trying to figure out who is going to get out tonight and who’s not. I tell my mom to call me if her flight ends up being cancelled so I can send a car to pick her up. If you really care, my mom’s flight ended up leaving at 11:30pm and she landed back home around 2:30am. I called her a Lyft and stayed up tracking it until she called me to report she was in the house. - **$23.10, my mom tipped in cash.**

Transport: $215.96

Other: $2100.46

**Reflections**

This wasn’t a typical week since it was Thanksgiving and I was hosting my mom, but my Day 1 is a typical spending day. I think I would have spent more if I had a different travel partner than my mother. She is extremely frugal and kept turning down stuff for us to do or buy even though I insisted it was my treat. In my defense, it’s my mom and I want to treat her. However, she did teach me good spending habits and it’s what gave me the push to find deals like the El Museo/City Museum partnership, the PHLASH fare, and ideas for things that we could experience for free or at a low-cost. I think I would say that I am better at spending money wisely but I want to get better at saving and building investments.

Okay, go ahead and roast me for still being on the family phone plan.","***I HAVE CREATED A SIGN UP THREAD***

Hey! First time making my own post in this subreddit! 

I often see people complain about not getting enough information about someone's career, how they got there, how they negotiated for their salary, what skills they acquired and leveraged along the way, and what kind of network helped them achieve their job/career/salary. 

Intially I was afraid to ask since this seems to be a subreddit about what to with the money you have, or what you will do with the money you get in the future. Similarly money diaries are just a snapshot of a week of spending (or should be). 

But for alot of us starting out or changing careers or looking to move upward, laterally, or onward salary and just career information is a big missing piece in the financial pie. (Its easier to make more happen with money when you have more to begin with) 

Refinery 29 occasionally does Salary Stories

[Chief of Staff $50,000](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/salary-story-chief-of-staff-new-orleans)


Anyway, I really love these kinds of stories and transparency. I'm not sure how to contact R29 and ask that they do these more frequently but I was wondering if Salary Stories could be included in this subreddit or if another one should be made? 

If anyone is interested in writing a Salary Story/Career Diary let me know and we can iron through the formatting or you can go freestyle I suppose. 

The jist would a be an overview of positions held and salaries/hourly pay at each. General job descriptions and skills used. How you transitioned between each or got the job. Whether or not you negotiated your salary and how you achieved/compromised in the final offer. I think adding tips and degrees or courses taken would be helpful if they were necessary to succeed or get the job. If you felt your degree or something you did was *not worth it* include that as well. Also any personal struggles you had to overcome or support you recieved. 

• Fin •

Edit: I would like to add that you don't have to be at the top of your career or anything. I initially framed this as upward mobility thing but realize we can also benefit from seeing some failures/mishaps (maybe get some advice when you share). Also some career paths you may consider normal or boring might be one someone else hadn't considered a viable option or someone else didnt even know existed :) A good blend will make it interesting if I coordinate a weekly or daily posting. Also career journeys that pay no mind to salary. Saw someone comment a while ago that they started off running a coffee shop then started a farm then became a yogi. That's interesting!","I really liked the post on what people can’t live without and I’m curious - what are things you’ve purchased / things you do that make your life feel a bit more luxurious and are worth it to you? These are things you would be willing to give up if you had to cut spending for some reason but as long as you have the disposable income, you’re going to keep buying. 

For me it’s probably:

• Spices - I have a fully stocked spice cabinet (just waffling on getting some saffron) and it makes cooking feel so much more luxurious when I can add cardamom pods to a cocktail or dessert or have my pick between whole and ground cumin. 

• Espresso maker - this is a recent acquisition but having a latte every morning makes me feel great. It makes me slow down in the mornings and it’s helping me cut down on my Diet Coke consumption which my doctor has been thrilled about. 

• Gel manicures every three weeks - I used to paint my nails every Sunday (and remove the polish / redo it as soon as it chipped). But with cooking and washing dishes more frequently, it meant I was doing my nails a couple times a week. I also couldn’t leave them bare because they were stained from dark colors. I go to a salon close to work, pay $50 after tip every three weeks, and don’t even have to think about my nails making me look less professional. 

I’d love to hear yours!","

Day 1, Tuesday April 14

Morning --- My body loves to wake up from 1-3am. No idea why. I always assumed it was from eating late at night but lately I have been skipping dinner, so what gives?  I usually try to read or something. My actual time to get up is 7 am, or two hours before shift starts. This usually covers an hour for commute. My district is expansive – McHenry, Lake Zurich, Western Springs, Ukrainian Village, Bridgeport -- all over Chicagoland grocery stores. I accepted this float position for boosted pay. Breakfast is flash frozen vegetables and two scrambled eggs smeared with pesto. I assume that I'm getting depressed with everything that is happening lately because my diet is all kinds of weird! I make instant coffee for my travel mug.

Lunch --- I have been sneaking bites of granola bars all morning because I know that I will want to eat like a crazy person for lunch! I had packed a protein bar but of course I want to leave my manager's side. I venture into the prepared foods section and decide on a salad ($5.11). It doesn't come with dressing and I waste my break time going back; it's going to cost 75 cents and I'm so cheap that I try to return the salad itself. Obviously, they cannot resell it but also you cannot return stuff during a pandemic. Sigh. I give in by buying a seafood salad ($5.18) -- a mixture of imitation crab and mayonnaise -- to eat together. For a person who wants to change food insecurity, I sure eat terribly.

The face mask is bothersome! Perhaps if I never spoke it would be okay but the humidity is causing irritation and acne all over the bottom of my face. Lunch was a nice break for my skin as well. We are allotted one single-use mask daily if there is supply. It wasn't created for all day use so I am careful to not degrade the integrity with moisture or my warm breath. 

Today is actually my first virtual interview for a public health job! I wasn't expecting these but I guess it's a part of the process. I excuse myself to use an empty closet for privacy. They were surprised that I still work with the public everyday; what else would I be doing? I told them there isn't personal protective equipment (PPE) at every location but I didn't have the heart to say that there's also no hand soap. How absolutely disgusting is that? There's no hand soap in some bathrooms. Academic people in their ivory tower, man. They just wonder how us proles are getting infected and dying.

I text message D. When I mentioned last week that I needed to learn zoom for my interview, he offered to practice with me! Unfortunately, I think we fizzled. We never met up before the shelter-in-place and his messages have dwindled to short responses to my messages. 

Dinner --- My legs are always exhausted when I get home. I reheat some rotisserie chicken with frozen vegetables. The rest of the night is spent on school busywork assignments and social media. Before I fall asleep, I check email on my phone. I already got the human resources rejection letter but I can be considered for another (lesser?) position if I would like. 

Total: $10.50

Day 2, Wednesday Apr 15

Morning -- I weave in and out of sleep all night! There were vivid dreams with old co-workers, new environments, and I wake when I lose control of the car that I am driving. Driving is common in my nightmares; I dislike driving. It's another odd breakfast of frozen vegetables and chicken. I am trying to eat less carbohydrates and take advantage of my decreased appetite; my melancholy has magnified - maybe this is my chance to cut out extraneous calories!

Lunch -- My schedule is unknown to me because I get rotated throughout the region. but I was expecting to be at this location two days in a row; I eat the rest of my odd salad + seafood salad mix from the day before.

Today’s manager … stinks. She tries to chastise me and I don't know how to retort 'Oh, I didn't understand because you mixed up these two basic business terms.'  

I read about the 60-car crash on the icy Kennedy expressway - I was dreaming about driving at that time! 

Dinner -- I prep my usual chicken and vegetables. Has this been the same meal for a week now? Taste perversion is a symptom of covid! Also I know that I lose my appetite when I get into this sadness funk.

There is something about essential oils on myfitnesspal and I dig up my stash. I like to use them at hot yoga but tonight it's for a calming bedtime. 

Total: $22.88

Day 3, Thursday Apr 16

Morning -- I have my usual restless night.  I don't know the actual length of time but it feels like hours of this sleep-wake state. D responds with so many pet pics but I suspect that I am still dreaming.  I rise 20 minutes before my alarm.

I received an email last night requesting an interview for this afternoon. That is fast, right? It is an alternate position. There is also other paperwork that is due next week. I am annoyed but excited when I read through the prospectives. 

Lunch -- It's sushi Thursday! I like to buy the $5 plates but also I am trying to cut carbs. I decide against it and actually eat what I packed! It's a slimfast bar with a bottle of water.

There is a webinar on supply chain. Finally, something interesting! This gives me a break away from the preceptor.  Goodness, my face mask area is angry from the constant moisture. The webinar allows some fresh air against my skin and it feels GLORIOUS.  

Oh. D never responded! I usually rotate through the dating apps. I cannot gain traction on a conversation. There might be a few exchanges, but it always ends as an expanded version of 'dtf?'

On the way out the door, I notice that toilet paper advertised with at least 200% markup. Shame on this company.

Dinner -- My bottomless rotisserie chicken and vegetables are reheated for supper.   My interview is... fine. It's another committee with some of the same people from before. The rest of the night is spent on homework and research. I should go back to watching lectures while I eat but the key word is 'should.'  

I made the mistake of retrieving my paystub. It's direct deposit weekly so I just note the usual amount that shows up in my bank statement. I am appalled at the union fees/dues. I peruse social media and continue to do so until I fall asleep. 

Total: none

Day 4, Friday Apr 17

Morning — I wake up to the pleasant lull of raindrops, excited that it is Fri-yay!

Lunch -- I packed my Aktins bar. It pales against the idea of hot food and no more small talk in the office. (When I say office, I mean two cubicles are located near the customer service desk. Lol.) The hot wings are on sale! I buy an entire bucket and then remember how ridiculous the prepared foods tax is (10.42). This first meal will be fantastic and the reheated leftovers will not be worth the calories. Sigh.

Dinner -- I'm reheating today's chicken. 

I make some warm tea to sooth this sadness. What is this emptiness that I feel? Why am I fetching socks in mid-April? I watch the first ten minutes of the Modern Family finale; I love the heart-warming endings of each episode.

Total: $10.42

Day 5, Saturday Apr 18

Morning -- I can sleep in! My shift doesn't begin until 10 am. I still wake up at 2 am, fall asleep, and rise at 6:45 am. My aging body doesn't do what I want all the time anymore -- getting old takes getting used to! Breakfast is my usual chicken and vegetables.

I work at a different company on the weekends. At the beginning of covid, they offered $5 a day as a small token for the sudden influx of work. The daily habit of shopping for clearance and quick sale items has stuck. I buy a bottle of vegan multivitamins (9.10)

Lunch -- At this location, this break room is spacious but also always filled with rambunctious young people. I quickly heat up my lunch (chicken and vegetables), eat, and spend the rest of my lunch break shopping for sales. I grab some salted caramel peanuts (0.91); I put back the cocoa peanuts because they expired in July 2019! Shame on this company as well.

There is a complaint about our Tylenol supply because it all expires next month. I agree with the patron but also I know that the area competitors are all out-of-stock on both brand and generic. I make a mental note to return that bottle that I bought recently.  

Dinner -- I still have my neverending chicken and vegetables.  I should simply toss it after a week, right? My giant warehouse bag of vegetable blend is almost ready to be replaced. There is an intriguing article about food diaries. If I was reflecting today: 

1. How do you feel before eating?⁣ Relieved to sit and get away from others
2. How hungry are you on a scale from 1-10?⁣ 2-5 most times
3. What did you eat?⁣ snack bars, granola bars, fried foods, rotisserie chicken, frozen vegetables
4. How do you feel after eating?⁣ Satiety
5. How does this align with your goals? It is definitely on my path. I am able to say 'no' to sweets and that is empowering. There is opportunity for improvement in my micronutrients and calorie restriction. ⁣

At work, I eat because I am afraid that I will be hungry at an inconvenient time, as though I neeed to (over)fill the tank every time I see the gas station. At home, I eat because I dislike waking up from hunger pangs - this happened a lot in my childhood.

Total: 10.11

Reflection: This forced me to see my current situation. I love my work; I'm not sure that I express that enough in my daily life. This is usually how I spend my time other than friends, dating, and exercise. My workout schedule usually ranges from 5-15 hours in a given week. Some days, I do back-to-back training in the same facility. I like to visit the gym at least every other day. There are some fitness classes that I enjoy but I only attend with my favorite instructors. I use dining out as social events so this pandemic has saved me cash and calories in that aspect!

I am surprised at the small expenses here and there - to get away from others, to step out of the office and get fresh air. 

I desperately want to stop living paycheck to paycheck. After years of unemployment, underemployment, and juggling multiple part-time jobs, I would love to have a consistent paycheck. My main goal right now is to cut through the student debt, build up a savings account and secure fulfilling work.

Weekly Total: $53.91 (Food: $44.81; Health and Wellness: $9.10; Clothing and Products: 0)","Those of us going through the pandemic alone are experiencing this situation in a very unique way (as was brought up in a different thread).  Quite honestly, I feel myself going a little bonkers at times.  I've learned that there is such a thing as too much alone time!  I'm interested in hearing your stories, methods of coping, and frankly I could use the distraction at this point.

I'll start:  50-ish, single, live alone in a 1-bed in a large building in NYC.  No friends in the hood, minimal interaction with my neighbors.  Friends and family are within a quick train ride (but that's not an option at this point).  I'm currently WFH but not for long  -furlough starts next week.  That's going to leave a huge gap of time in my day and I'm sure my anxiety and frustration levels will reach new highs.

How have you been doing?  Do you have any social interaction during the day (phone, video chats, etc).  How do you keep yourself occupied and sane?

Please share.  Not here to judge, just to interact.

Edit: loving the posts and suggestions. we’re all in this tough place together!  🤎kudos to you ladies & our Miami man for sharing your stories.","So I’m ridiculously frugal, probably to a fault (I coupon like a crazy person and am wearing 10 year old undies omg), and it seems like the pandemic has made me spend more on comforting things, like new stationery and leggings, when ordinarily I’d shrug it off and make do with what I have. I’ve only been buying local or small business, so that makes me feel a tiny bit better, but still wow. 
 
Anyone else in the same boat?","Hello all,  So I'm starting my YNAB journey and let me tell you, I want to cry.  I am almost sick to my stomach at the amount of money I spent on cigarettes, ordering out and booze.  Yuck!!!!  

Having said this; Happy New Year to all and those with vices, hoping we can make some fantastic life changes this coming year.  

Thank You Money Diary Gang :) 

\-Me","Hear me out. (Disclaimer: I am talking about my own experiences as well as experiences from other women I know in middle-management/senior leadership)

I recently got a big promotion and was moved to a salaried employee after starting from the bottom at my current company. One thing I wasn’t ready for at all was having all this free time to just THINK and actually strategize/research/etc.

It was really hard to adjust to. As a coordinator, I was getting all the little (but time consuming, just not important) things given to me (which, of course, is very normal) and I feel like I was just completing tasks and moving on without actually having time to work on larger projects that I also had. 

Now, I hardly ever get after-hours or weekend emails like I used to. I used to work 1-3 hours each weekend, but now I just skim to make sure I’m not missing anything and respond to emails if I need to.

The work is much more interesting and slower-paced because I’m expected to be more of an expert than a task-manager. It’s true, the stakes are higher, but it’s really really REALLY nice not to have that crazy busy-work-jack-of-all-trades stress anymore. And, sure, I do work the occasional 10 hour day here and there - but I’d much rather do that than deal with the minutia and weekend busy work.

Anyone else had this experience?

Edited: some words :)","**Section One:** Assets and Debt

**Retirement Balance** About $110,000 in an IRA, this is an accumulation of two different 401(k) accounts from my two previous US employers. I have always contributed the maximum amount needed to get the highest employer match. My current company is big overseas but just a start-up in the US so we do not have a 401(k) program yet. The IRA is currently being managed by a robo-advisor and put into a portfolio of growth/aggressive ETFs. I could do it on my own but since I deal with investments all day, I don’t want to have to think it in my spare time. I find that robo-advisors are a cost-effective way of managing this portfolio.

**Savings account balance** I have about 28,000 pounds from the time I lived in the UK. It is just in a savings account right now earning nothing. I keep meaning to do something about this but haven’t got around to it.

I also have about $183,000 in a high yield cash account (interest rate is 2.32%, it was 2.57% but got reduced due to the Fed rate cut); $50,000 invested in a private real estate deal that is going to yield me 8% in a year; a stock portfolio of about $5,000, just to keep my eye on some hot single stock names that my clients always ask about. I have been researching some private short-term investment opportunities that yield above average returns. A friend I’ve met from working in the industry has started a company that offers opportunities which could meet my needs so I expect to take around $50,000-$100,000 out of my savings in the near future to invest, the expected annualized return is about 10%.

**Checking account balance** I keep around $7,000-8,000 in my checking account at all times because every bill is on automatic payment including rent, utilities, gym etc, not to mention all my various credit cards so I never want to go into overdraft. I generally transfer whatever is leftover to my savings account at the end of the month.

**Credit card debt (and how you accumulated it)** I have 8 credit cards open and use 3-4 regularly, depending on which card will give me the most reward points for that specific category of spending. I pay off all the balances in full every month.

**Student loan debt (for what degree)** None. I am an EU citizen and got both my undergrad and graduate degrees in the UK. Undergrad tuition was about 1,000 pounds per year (raised to 3,000 the year after I started), and my Masters was about 13,000 pounds – parents generously paid for both.

**Section Two: Income**

**Main Job Monthly Take Home:** $260,000 salary + $20,000 guaranteed cash bonus, net paycheck is about $13,525 (I get paid monthly). I am also eligible for an annual discretionary cash bonus which can range wildly (anywhere between 10% to 100%+ of my base). Since my job is a rather new venture, I have no way of predicting how much that will be so I have left it out of my income. I am also getting stock options, currently talking with exec team on how to best structure it.

**Section Three: Expenses**

**Rent:** $2,450 for a two-bedroom in Manhattan. It’s in an old, walk-up building and both bedrooms are tiny so one is my closet, but the living area is spacious and the location is very convenient.

**Renters / home insurance** Renter’s insurance $120 per year.

**Medical Insurance** $422 (which is 50% of the monthly premium, employer pays the other 50%). This is super high because I decided to go private as our company’s insurance plan is not great and cost about the same. I am on an ex-pat plan that covers absolutely everything, no deductible/no-copay for any doctors visits or medication (apart from the birth control pill). This includes dental and vision as well – dental covers everything (including root canal and implants 100%) up to $6,000 per year and vision includes a free exam and $310 towards contact lenses/glasses. It is VERY expensive but the benefits are excellent.

**Birth Control Pill:** $15 per month, I go for the generic brands.

**Savings contribution** I tend to do one big transfer to my savings account at the end of the month depending on how much is left in my checking account.

**Investment contribution** None consistently, a couple hundred dollars here and there if I want to purchase a particular stock for the sole purpose of watching it, so I can talk to clients about it. As mentioned above, I am looking for private investment opportunities instead of participating in the public market. I feel my IRA is enough market exposure right now.

**Debt payments** Just my credit card payments which I pay the balance in full each month.

**Donations** I volunteer with three organizations, all centered around education/job readiness. Two are targeted at disadvantaged youths from lower-income families/neighborhoods, and one targeted at immigrant women with little or no family support in the US. I also buy seats at benefits/galas of charities my friends are involved in on an ad-hoc basis to support them, these range around $50-$250 a pop. I personally prefer to volunteer my time if I can, instead of donating money just because I feel it is more tangible and I can see/feel the difference I am making no matter how small. I have been trying to get more involved, and perhaps get a board seat in one of the charities I currently volunteer with.

**Electric** Varies between $50 - $90, summer is a little higher due to AC/fans working overtime.

**Wifi/Cable/Landline** I recently got rid of cable so I am paying $55 for just internet alone. I need to look for a better deal.

**Cellphone** $100 which includes unlimited data (super important to me), I should also see if I can get this cheaper elsewhere.

**Subscriptions** Amazon Prime - $119 per year; Netflix – I share with two friends and we got the 4 screen option so my share is about $5 per month; HBO - $15 per month (will cancel as soon as I finish *Big Little Lies*); AMC A-List: $20 per month.

**Gym membership** $90 - I have one-club access to the Equinox right next to my work, this is a family discount and is pretty much the lowest price for Equinox I’ve ever heard of. I also supplement with ClassPass (usually just the 15 credits) on the weekends I'm in town, which cost $20 per month. On top of that, I actually pay $50 per year for an audio-based fitness app called Aaptiv, they have different classes for different categories of exercises (like treadmill, elliptical, strength training etc), and there’s fresh new content every week. This has drastically changed the way I work out on my own!

**Cleaning lady** $65 every 3-4 weeks. I travel quite often so this interval works best for me.

**Paid hobbies** $10 for an online Introductory Course to Python, I am waiting for my friend so we can start together, it’s meant to be a 3 months course. I also pay $50 for a private language tutor to keep up with my German but this is very sporadic due to my work schedule. I should really just find a language exchange person instead.

**Monday**

7:15am – First alarm goes, this is purposefully early because I know my snooze-hitting hand will reach out and shut it off without my brain even fully comprehending what’s going on. Happy Monday!

8:00am – Open one bleary eye and have to confront the dreaded fact that I should be out of bed at this point. Scroll through E-mail/text to make sure my work world hasn’t blown up, quick look through personal whatsapp messages and Instagram. Hop out of bed, ask googlehome to tell me news via the podcasts I set up as part of my “morning routine”, brush teeth, wash face with cold water and put on moisturizer with SPF. I don't wear make-up to work unless there are external meetings. I also shower at night to save precious time in the morning. Bring a yoghurt and an apple to work. My job provides decent snacks, but they do not carry fresh fruits or other perishables. Rush out the door at 8:35am.

9:10am – Decide to walk instead of taking uber because traffic can be so unpredictable, walking takes about 35 minutes. Listen to podcast on the way (Monday is *Crime Junkie* day). Office is half empty as a lot of people are travelling this week. Boost up my computer, fill up my water bottle, grab a coffee with a shot of Bulletproof Brain Octane Oil in it, I’ve recently started doing this and have definitely noticed it keeps me full until lunch. I flirt with the idea of intermittent fasting since I am never super hungry in the mornings, but haven't fully committed to it yet.

12:30pm –Go for a client lunch at a nice spot near work, seafood and sushi are this place’s specialties. I have a small sushi appetizer and fried cod sandwich which is more like a burger, and much heavier than I anticipated. Client updates me on his life and I mentally file away information that I need to add to his file. (**$65.12 expensed**)

3:00pm – Resist the urge to get a coffee even though I really want one. I am trying to stick to one coffee in the morning only, as I think caffeine later in the day really messes up my sleeping pattern. This never used to be the case but I guess I am getting older, and my body is not coping as well with the erratic diet/sleep schedule I often put it through. Remember I brought an apple with me so have that as a snack.

5:30pm – I am supposed to go to this trial boxing/strength class but I think I hurt my sciatic nerve doing back-to-back classes on the weekend so decide last minute to sit this one out. This is a free class for first-timers so I hope I don’t get charged for late cancel. Text with a friend and decide we both really want Korean chicken wings. Make plans to meet up in Korean Town later tonight.

6:30pm – Quickly walk home so I can drop off my laundry a couple blocks away. I don’t have a washer/dryer in my building but at this point, even if I did, I would probably still send it out for the convenience of it.

7:15pm – Right before I head out to dinner, E texts me to ask if I want to meet up. He is probably best described as a casual hookup at this point, we met about 2 months ago, live super close and see each other about once a week. He’s a resident at the hospital working 16 hour days, and studying for his medical board exams so he literally has NO time (apart from the 1 hour at the gym he sticks to every day religiously). I’m not sure if I want something serious either so this is perfect…for now. I briefly consider cancelling on my friend (he’ll understand) but decide not to. I want to say it’s because I want to appear less available, which is true, but really it's also because I want those damn chicken wings!

7:30pm – Meet up with my friend at BonChon chicken, we order pork buns, soy and garlic combo (wings and drumsticks) and some fries to share. Everything was delicious, we split the bill evenly. **$38.52**

9:30pm – I get home and watch an episode of *Big Little Lies*, I’m trying to ration myself to one episode at a time so I don’t go through them too quickly. Afterwards, I do my night routine: shower, brush teeth, floss (when I remember), mild foam cleanser, vitamin C serum and moisturizer. I also dab on eye cream if I can be bothered, which is probably twice a week.

11:15pm – Successfully get into bed at my target time, but end up being too engrossed in the book I am reading (*Lethal White* by Robert Galbraith, aka JK Rowling) so don’t switch off the light until 12:45…I’ll regret this I am sure. I am also intermittently texting with R, a friend of a friend I met at a gig a few weeks ago that I’ve been hooking up with. It’s new and fun, not sure if it’s leading anywhere yet but we make tentative plans to see each other later this week.

**Tuesday**

8am – Running a little behind so only have time to hear one of the three news podcasts I set up. Quickly put on some mascara and lipstick after washing/moisturizing my face, and remember to bring a change of gym clothes with me as I head out. My gym is a block away from work so I usually leave my gym bag there, and just change out gym clothes.

9:15am – Get into work and promptly grab coffee! Eat my yoghurt with honey roasted almond slices while replying to what feels like a gazillion emails. I work quite a bit with our overseas team/clients so mornings can be really busy. That’s why I try to take a few minutes every morning to make sure I have a to-do list for the day. Granted sometimes nothing gets crossed off because emergencies happen and you never know how the day might turn out, but it at least gives me the semblance of having some control. This is not happening today so I feel frazzled all morning, thinking I’ve missed something very important...

12:00pm – Business lunch. One of the funds we are hoping to partner with takes me out to a new upscale ramen/udon place in midtown. The bowl is bigger than my face, and they serve Lady M cake for dessert. Great food overall, and very productive conversations as we work through potential ways to collaborate, they pick up the tab. I can't wait to come back here in the dead of winter!

2:30pm - Take a break to walk outside with a colleague, she is picking up coffee and I resist. On the way back, we walk through a farmer's market and I pick up a dozen apple cider donuts for the team as a small treat. I take one with me back to my desk as I power through the afternoon. (**$16**)

5:30pm – Finish reading our short-term consultant’s business strategy plan for a specific product we want to launch. Not only was he a week late in turning this in, the plan itself is also not detailed at all. He owes us financial projections at the very least, and without it the document is just 20 pages of high level drivel. Pen a quick memo to the CEO (who’s travelling) and CIO (who’s home sick) and decide to call it a day.

6:00pm – On the walk home, I pick up my laundry **($13.25** for 13 pounds)

7:00pm – I go to AMC to meet with my friend’s new husband, we both have A-list so movie is free\*.\* My friend just got married and her husband moved to NYC for her so he doesn’t have a lot of friends here. She’s busy tonight so suggested her husband and I hang out, it was great getting to know him better! We each bought the Tuesday special, which is a small popcorn and a drink for **$5**.

10:00pm – Back home and quickly shower and do my night skincare routine (if you can call it that), it is still so humid and I feel like I am constantly drenched in sweat. I browse flights for a bit – my best friend from middle school is getting married in Barcelona in October, and I want to combine that with a visit to London so I am checking for available flight options. Set the price watch on a couple flights but don’t purchase anything yet, I need to consult with other friends so we can coordinate our schedules.

11:30pm – Catch up on group chats with some friends in Asia, we try to figure out tentative plans for a trip together possibly early next year. I will be in Asia for work at least once before the year is out, but not sure I can take extra time off around then. Try to read *Where the Crawdads Sing* on my kindle (I usually read a few books at the same time), but pass out not too long after.

**Wednesday**

7:30am – Wake up a little early as I’m attending a breakfast event downtown this morning. Quickly go through usual morning routine, plus mascara and lipstick then rush out to catch the subway, pray there will be coffee there…**$2.75**

10:30am – Event is awesome, meet with some interesting people over bagels and coffee. Afterwards, I was going to subway back up to my office in midtown but the route is not super direct, and I have a ton of messages from last night/this morning to sift through, as well as a few calls to make so I opt for a cab. The downside is when I get stuck in traffic, and when the driver was a bit too chatty but for the most part it feels like I am in a mobile office so it is pretty productive. ($15.60+$2 tip, **$17.60 expensed**)

12:15pm – Head to the gym for a lunchtime workout. I was too late to sign up for the spin class but luckily they have a spot available. 45 minutes in the saddle is exactly what I needed. I only do spin at Equinox if it is the game-based ones, which make time go by much faster! I still feel the sciatic nerve not 100% recovered so I do some foam rolling and stretches afterwards, and take a quick shower. I nip next door and get a poke bowl with salmon, edamame, seaweed, scallion and brown rice doused in ponzo sauce for lunch (**$13.61**)

3:00pm – Spend almost all afternoon trying to finish up content for the new brochure we are printing, need to get it to the marketing team before we sit down to discuss ideas for presentation/layout. Also make a start on the content for the new website, but keep on getting interrupted by client calls/emails. Resist the urge to get coffee.

6:00pm – Uber to Soho for a wine tasting event. \*\*(\*\*$24.11 + $3 tip = **$27.11 expensed**) It is a club started by and catered to professional women where we get together and usually have a speaker on a topic of interest whether it be business, networking or professional development. Today, the topic is ""ally, mentor, sponsor"". Plenty of wine and food, and I readily indulge in both.

9:00pm – Uber back upown to meet up with R ($11.07 + $1 tip = **$12.07**), we texted earlier today when I told him that AMC now serves alcohol and he asked me to go today, but since I had the earlier event, we decided to just meet at a bar instead. I get one more glass of wine and have a couple bites of his food, he pays.

11:00pm – We go to Van Leeuwen near my apartment because it is still hot out and we are greedy. I get one scoop of honeycomb in a cup and he gets two scoops in a cone, I insist on paying since he picked up the check earlier. **($15.70)**

11:15pm – Get home and put on the first episode of *The Boys* on Amazon Prime as my coworker was raving about it but fall asleep about 10 minutes in, typical! Retire to bed and set alarm a little earlier because R has to be at work by 8am.

**Thursday**

7:15am – R woke me up as he was leaving, I stay in bed to scroll through messages and Instagram. Get out of bed and put on the news podcast as I brush my teeth and wash my face. I also remember to bring the collagen matcha powder I bought from amazon to work to add to my morning coffee.

8:30am – Walk to work while listening to *Hidden Brain*.

9:15am – Getting settled at my desk. Pour the collagen matcha powder into office coffee, I love the smell of matcha but the taste is not very strong. I also make a smoothie from this powder pouch I bought last week but just got delivered yesterday. It supposedly contains two servings of your daily fruit/veggie requirements with no added badness. The taste is a little artificial but still delicious, and there are 6 different flavors so I am looking forward to trying them all.

12:30pm – Meet with a friend at a steak house across my office since he’s usually in Tribeca but happen to work out of midtown today. We opt for the business lunch menu and get a small cup of lobster bisque and 6 oz filet mignon with mashed potatoes. It is nice to catch up, and I pick his brains about starting a business since he’s done it a few times already. He promises to send me some sample business plans. I am not starting my own business, but I am heading up a brand new division for an established company, this is their first overseas venture so I could definitely benefit from those pointers. He picks up the tab as a business expense.

3pm – Office is quiet which gives me a chance to catch up on some E-mails. We are hosting a group of 20+ business partners from out of town in a few weeks, a lot of logistics to go through, putting out fires everywhere. The stress is giving me the munchies – wander into the pantry and snack on some fruit and nuts trail mix.

4:30pm - Meet with a client at our building's private rooftop. It has a really nice view of midtown and is generally pretty quiet. Client gets a beer and urges me to get a glass of wine but I resist since I am technically still working, I get an iced tea lemonade instead. ($13 + $1.5 tip = **$14.5 expensed**)

6:30pm – Uber to a summer celebration event for a company we worked with ($16.85 + $2 tip = **$18.85 expensed**). The co-founders have become very good friends and this is a casual fun event at a rooftop so I asked J to come with me. I’ve been casually seeing J for about 5 months but our ""relationship"" has been a little rocky lately. He made it clear from the very beginning that he didn’t want anything serious but now has started hinting at being exclusive, but he’s also very flaky as a person and is dealing with a lot of work and family drama. I know I am not ready to get into a relationship with him but we always have fun together.

9:00pm – The party is winding down, it was open bar and free food but J tipped the bartender generously (about $40 bucks) so we were given premium liquor and even did a couple of shots. J used to work in the hospitality industry so he always takes care of the bartenders/waitresses/doormen whenever we go out, which I respect. I want him to sleep over as we are pretty close to my apartment, but he has an early day tomorrow and an important meeting. And he also makes a point of telling me he wants to spend time with me, not just for sex. I appreciate the respect but honestly I am also a little disappointed.

11:00pm –On my walk home, a friend who lives in the same neighborhood randomly messages me so I meet her at our local pizza joint. This is the first time we catch up after our trip to a mutual friend’s overseas wedding last month. I only get a water while she gets two slices, and we happily gossip for an hour. (**$2**)

12:30am - I walk home and force myself to go through my already very basic night routine. Pass out as soon as my head hits the pillow. No reading for me tonight.

**Friday**

8:30am – Running super behind and got a couple of E-mails I need to get out so uber it is, even though it is surging!  ($14.03 + $1 tip = **$15.03**)

12:15pm – So glad I’m being taken out to lunch, I was starving all morning and didn’t get a chance to eat breakfast. I meet with the representative of a former corporate client. We really clicked and have become friends outside of the office, always a bonus! We strategize on new ways to collaborate now that I am at a new firm. The food is fantastic, we get pulled pork tacos, calamari, homemade squid ink pasta and pistachio ice cream to share. She treats.

4:00pm – Happy Friday! Office is half empty so coworkers break out the beer. I don’t drink beer but happy to wrap up early and chat with everyone.

5:00pm  -Hit the gym for a quick 30min treadmill run and 10min abs routine. I definitely took it a little easier on myself during the workout, but a slower run is better than no run at all! The 15min in the steam room afterwards felt fantastic too! Gotta step up the intensity of my workouts next week.

7:00pm – My friend is hosting a little musical salon at her apartment. I pick up a bottle of prosecco on the way over (**$19.65**). There are cheeseboards and pizzas, as well as a homemade cake and fruit platters.  We are treated to a mini concerto of piano and cello accompaniments, the performers are professional musicians who are using us as test audience for a piece they will be performing soon. So basically we just heard a super high quality concert in a super intimate setting for free!

9:30pm - Uber to Pegu Club for a cocktail with some other friends ($9.57 + $1 tip = **$10.57**). Earlier in the day, I made plans to meet up with E later tonight, and he texts to let me know he is wrapping up his friend's birthday party. He asks if he can meet me at Pegu Club and I ask the girls if it's okay, they jump at the chance to meet the ""hot doctor"". He comes and hangs out with us, and he is super affectionate which is a little weird. This is the first time he's meeting any of my friends, they really like him. I pay for my two drinks plus tip (**$42**)

1am - We decide to call it a night and walk over to Joe's Pizza, but the line is super long and we don't want to wait. Say goodbye to everyone and E calls an uber back to his place. We chat a bit more, have sex and then I leave. I never sleep over at his because I live 3 blocks away and prefer my own bed. He's asked if I wanted to stay a couple of times before, but I'm not sure if he was just being nice or he actually means it. Since we always met up on week nights before, I know he always has to wake up at 4:30am so I never wanted to stay. Interestingly enough, he did not ask this time...

2:30am - Finally in bed and text with friends until I pass out.

**Saturday**

10am - There are so many messages on my phone, the alert vibrations finally wake me up. Logistics for the October wedding + drunk texts from J from last night. Nothing urgent enough to stop me from going back to sleep.

11:30am - Workout at Brrrn studio, it's a whole body HIIT workout in a 50 degree room (8 credits on ClassPass). I didn't do as well because my muscle/nerve is still giving me trouble, I make a mental note to reach out to my friend who's a pain management doctor to see if I can get an appointment next week.

12:45pm - I impulse text R because he lives in that neighborhood to see if he wants to grab brunch, turns out my timing is perfect because he's just finished with the gym too. We go to The Smith and I devour the burger and fries, all washed down with delicious cold brew. We split the bill. (**$25.86**)

2:30pm - We walk towards Washington Square Park and stop at an ice cream place for dessert. He treats. After lounging on the grass for a bit, I walk home to take a shower and change for dinner.

7:00pm - My friend and I have a reservation at Frevo's. It's a small restaurant inside an art gallery (the entrance is behind a painting). Food is traditional French tasting menu served around chef's counter, and it is amazing! Well thought-out flavorful dishes, friendly/knowledgeable staff, and not nearly as pretentious as it sounds! We decided against the wine pairing because it was quite expensive, but maybe will come back and try that for a special occasion. (**$176.88**)

10pm - Walk home and debate going out to meet some friends for drinks but the couch is very comfortable. I see that LincTix has *The Sound Inside* listed on their website so I quickly get the first available date in September. (**$35**) I also get on amazon and order a set of 6 succulents and some candles for my friend's new office as a ""office warming"" present. (**$45.66**)

**Sunday**

10:30am - I completely forgot I signed up for a rowing class (because my ClassPass credits are expiring - this was 10 credits). I quickly throw on workout clothes and practically jog to the studio. The class was just okay, a little more monotonous than other ones I've been to. I quickly rush home, shower and change.

12:30pm – Go to a bottomless brunch place with some friends in East Village, I wasn’t planning on drinking but the deal is too good to pass up. (**$38.00**) The waitress keeps on topping up our glasses before we are even half finished, so I don’t keep track of how much I drink.

2:30pm - Feeling extremely tipsy, I stumble home in an uber and nap. (**$4.60**)

5:00pm – Groggily wake up to a bunch of messages from friends and my parents. Shoot, I was supposed to call my parents earlier and forgot, they live in Europe so now it is too late to ring back. I feel super guilty and quickly send an apologetic text, hopefully I can catch them during the week.

8:00pm - Meet up with two friends for dinner in our neighborhood, we split burrata and flatbread appetizers, and I get a steaming bowl of mussels. Definitely no alcohol for me! (**$28.00**)

10:00pm - I do a slightly more expanded version of my normal skincare routine on Sunday nights: double cleanse, face mask, serum, eye cream (which I know, I really should do daily), moisturizer. I get into bed and read more of *Lethal White*, and also start a new detective mystery books by a Norwegian author (*The Bat* by Jo Nesbo). First of a series and I'm already not loving the style but I've been told it gets better, so I'll stick it out!

**Reflections**

This is a pretty typical week for me. I am not shocked to see the majority of spending is on food/drinks, but I am a little surprised to see how quickly those uber trips add up!

I sometimes spend more on entertainments/experiences, whether it is going to a show/concert or pay for trips, which didn't happen this week.

I am not a big shopper for clothes or make-up but I am a sucker for designer bags and will typically invest in one or two good pieces during the year. My total would look completely different had I bought a bag or booked an international trip during the week!

Overall, I am comfortable with the general state of my finances but I do want to take personal investments a bit more seriously. I am hoping to make significantly more money through bonuses in the next 3-5 years, and I want to make sure the money won't sit idle.

I also included a bit more detail about my life in general, not just finances because I always enjoyed reading those in other MDs, (even if some may seem a little TMI), sorry if that makes this a rather long read!

Please feel free to ask me anything in the comments!","The best thing I’ve bought for less than $200 is hands down my Kitchenaid stand mixer, I use that thing four times a week. Honorable mentions include my lulu align pants and personalized return labels/stationery from Etsy.

Edit: guys, this was so fun!! 💜💜","This probably isn't that crazy but it feels like a big deal to me! I think I'll make it my goal to pay off my student loan debt in 2020. 

I've always paid at least double the minimum payment on my student loans because I want them OUT OF MY LIFE. I realized that I'm going to need a new car soon and I can't reconcile taking on more debt while my student loans loom over me. 

It's not going to be easy! If I want to reach my goal, I'll have to pay $660 per month which is about a quarter of my income. Wish me luck, friends! Happy new decade!","What have you realized that you don't miss / don't intend to restart after social distancing?

For me:

* I already hated my gym's parking lot and the machines got really crowded in January. Rearranged my apartment and sticking with home workouts.
* I am so relaxed now that I don't have a 30-60 minute commute each way. It's possible for me to work from home more often than I was, and I'm going to try to keep doing it.
* I already wasn't that into fancy cocktail bars, seeing the change in my spending reinforces that I'm going to start inviting my cocktail-loving friends to other activities instead.
* I had a falling-out with an old friend last year and felt kind of ambivalent/sad about it - partly we grew apart and partly she wanted a lot more support than I could give her, while accusing me of not being a good friend. I am so happy she's not calling me up to complain right now.","I was thinking about this a lot this week. This pandemic has been a big wake-up call. While I am doing ok financially (I have a pretty good paying job in that I can afford all of my bills and have a comfortable lifestyle, I do not have a ton of debt and I have a very dedicated debt repayment plan for what I do have, and I have pretty good retirement savings and a small emergency fund) this made me rethink a lot of what I was doing.

Before, I had a small emergency fund (usually $1,500 or so) that I would dip into for things like unexpected vet bills or car repairs. I had to put a few larger things on my credit card, but I don't have a ton of debt so I was able to pay it off fairly quickly. I spent quite a few years serving part time on top of working a full time job, so do you know what my plan was if I ever lost my regular day job? ""I'll just find a serving job and do that until I find another full time day job."" Which I think would have worked out ok, BUT then coronavirus happened. LOOOOOL to getting a serving job when all bar and restaurant staff have also lost their jobs with the exception of places who have staff working to do drive-thru, pick-up, and delivery orders. Luckily I'm able to work from home and still have my job. My husband was laid off but is receiving the CERB (we are in Canada) so we are ok for now and we definitely had a lot of expenses we could cut back on.

Anyways, here are the changes I will be making:

\- Getting an actual emergency fund, I will be contributing a lot more each month to this  
\- Paying the debt I have off and KEEPING IT PAID OFF  
\- Stop spending so much money on things like coffee, grabbing lunch at work because I am lazy and didn't bring one, etc. (I mean, I love going out to eat with friends, but I will definitely be more careful with this)  
\- I will be doing more workouts at home with occasional in person classes (like maybe one a week) at the barre studio I previously had an unlimited membership at  
\- And, I will be a lot more mindful with clothing, make-up, and other beauty purchases","I figure that with 14k members we must live in a lot of different areas so I'm wondering, even though no one is really traveling at this time, what would you all would recommend to do in your areas in the 0-(or your currency converted to dollars)$15 range, 15-$50 range and $100+ range?  This can include restaurants, touristy stuff, specific items to buy, etc.","Maybe we all need to let off a little steam in a not-hurtful way... what are your biggest MD pet peeves when it comes to the phrases either the diarists or editors use constantly?

I'll go first:

* body shower (it's a shower, you can just denote when you wash your hair if it means that much to you)
* chug water
* pass out
* inhale \[insert food here\]

What are yours?

ETA: can’t believe I misspelled peeves into peevers!",,"My experience living in both Canada and America is that most people think they are 'middle class'. This of course is not true, and I finally found a tool (by OECD) that lets you know where your current income (or household income) lies when compared to people your age in your country. 

Some of us are much richer/poorer/more average than we think. 

Find it at: [compareyourincome.org](http://compareyourincome.org)

My results:

My families income bracket is a higher percentile than I expected. I think it's because my neighborhood/schools I went to growing up were fairly homogeneous wealthwise so it made me think what I saw the most was average.

Edit: doesn't take into account debt/assets or whether or not you live in a HCOL vs LCOL; it compares you to the whole country","Does anyone else feel that saving money is a drag? 

I am hoping to buy a house in the next 5 years. Which houses in my area that I would want are (350,000). And I just having trouble feeling motivated to keep saving for something so big and far away. Especially when not buying new leggings is only $70 and a house down payment and moving expenses are 70,000+. I know you don’t need the full 20% but having it would save money over the course of the mortgage. 

Just feels insurmountable. Anyone else having trouble feeling like big money goals are achievable? What do you do stay motivated?

I am also trying, between retirement accounts and savings, to put away 50% of my after tax income which is very aggressive at 55k a year for my cost of living area. And between that and expenses I need to pay, car registration, vet bills, heat, etc. it’s just frustrating to feel like all the money is gone as soon as I get paid.","I realize how wordy I am, with how long this is, so I hope reading it isn't too time-consuming :)

**Basic Info:**

Occupation: Registered Nurse

Location: SF Bay Area (Peninsula)

Salary: $192,000

**Section One: Assets and Debts:**

Retirement: $120,000 (avoiding looking at it now, due to the drop in the stock market. Trying to keep my sanity :))

Pension: $150,000 (my workplace is one of the few to offer this, and it really incentivizes you to stay there for a while)

Checking account: $4,000 ish 

Savings: I have a few, it’s my way of keeping positivity and hoping to one day buy a house, albeit it most likely won’t be in the Bay, since it’s so expensive here. 

CD (for house) :$30,377 (initially put in $30k last year, with a 1.75% APY)

Big savings: $26,602 (my husband contributes $150 a paycheck towards this, for clarity) ( I will transfer this to a CD once the one above matures and combine them)

Emergency fund: $2478.00

Vacation Fund: $1662.00

**Monthly Income: Pre-tax**

$15,000-$15,500  a month, pre-tax

$7500-$8000 take home, after taxes and retirements

(I work nights, so on top of base pay, there is a 16% differential, 5% on top of that if you work weekends, of which we are required to do 4-5 a month, and an additional $2.50 if you are the charge nurse, which I do about 5 times per month. I also get a $41.53 per paycheck specialty certification reimbursement, which technically covers the cost of taking a certification test and maintaining it via CEUs). I also, during non-COVID-19 times, teach at my hospital, around 12 hours a month, which is additional pay.

**Monthly Costs:**

Rent: $3230 (Our two-bedroom apartment, includes $50 cat rent per month)

Credit Card Debt: $0. I have two credit cards from Chase; my personal one is the Chase Sapphire Reserve (i.e. my green card) and my husband and I split the Chase Sapphire Preferred (i.e. the blue card). I/we pay off the balance each month. I’d say that my personal card is about $2000.00 a month and the shared card is in the area of $1400-$1700.

Annual Fees: Green Card -$450, although it is going up to $550 in July when it renews. Ugh.

Blue Card: $95, goes through at end of April

Student Loans: About $10,436 left. I pay over the minimum every month, about $300 total, to finish off nursing school loans and a little bit left of graduate school loans.

House Fund: $2200 month/ $300 from husband (he has a lot of debt that he is working through, and there is a large difference in income)

Emergency Fund: $600/month

Vacation Fund: $400/month

Car insurance: $0/month right now, as I paid it in a 6-month chunk, equates to about $70/month

Wifi: $100.00 month (I pay for all of this)

PG & E, Electric and Gas :Ranges from $65 in the summer to $350.00 in winter (I pay for all of this). Makes me very ragey, that they don’t seem to have a reason and they are shady. PG&E is the major utility in Northern California, and they are responsible for multiple fires that have plagued us each year for the past few years, especially the Camp Fire, that killed so many people.I hate them and don’t have a utility choice.

Conservice: Water, Sewer, Garbage: $150ish (I pay for all of this)

Spotify Family $15.00 (Covers myself, husband, and best friend. You can add up to 5 people!)

Donations:

$20/month to the Wild at Heart Foundation, out of the UK. They rescue dogs from terrible abuse situations and help to place them. Please google Maggie the Wonder Dog to find out more! I’ll usually throw another $20 at them if they are having a drive or a specific pet need.

$20/month for Beagle Freedom Project: They rescue beagles that are subject to laboratory testing and place them in homes and rehabilitate them. They also have acute needs for emergency rescues, so I will donate to them when they need money urgently, usually also $20. 

$20/month to The Odd Cat Sanctuary: Helping to place cats that have disabilities and/or were at kill shelters. They do great work. 

As  you can tell, I love animals. I want to help as many as I can; please check out their instagrams (all of them have the names of their foundations) and help them if they seem good to you!

Patreon: $7/month. I subscribe to/support Christine McConell, who is basically a spooky Martha Stewart. She’s incredible.

Random other things:

2 Wine Clubs (Every 3 months): $250 total; I get 6 bottles of wine total from 2 different wineries. This also allows me to get “free (i.e. included)” tastings at both of these wineries, which are local. 

Day One:

0845: I wake up without an alarm, which I find to be so relaxing during this time. Since I am leaving the house once a day, to run, I don’t feel the need to wake up at a certain time. It’s really relaxing. I scroll my phone to check my emails, reply to a few group texts I’m in (nursing co-workers, group of my running friends, my parents) and obviously go through Instagram.

0945: Coffee via Nespresso, and an egg and cheese in a tortilla. Not sure if that qualifies as a burrito, but I’ll take it. I don’t love eggs so much but I am trying to eat more of them, as they are healthy and I’ve read that they are good for women trying to conceive. After this, I take two gummy prenatal vitamins and two Calcium gummy vitamins.

12:00: After finishing up on some YouTube, I putz around the house some more, and bug my husband while he works from home. 

13:30: Head out to get some fresh air and go on a 4-mile run on the pavement. I am 99% normally a trail runner, but there isn’t a lot of space to be 6 feet apart on the trails, and it upsets me a lot that people aren’t being serious about it. It makes it easier for me to move if we are on the streets. I relish the sunshine and am so happy that it isn’t raining. 

15:00: After running, I shower and eat some lunch, plus put some laundry in. Wow, I'm exciting. 

16:00 I go out onto the porch and start to read “The Nightingale”, that I’ve had for years and never got around to reading. It’s really good and I’m devouring it, while listening to the French Indie channel on Spotify (really great background music). My husband brings me some beer from a local place, Blue Oak Brewing, and we split one of their sour IPA crowlers.

19:00: We make dinner, some fried chicken (a Paula Deen recipe that we make about once a year because it is way too salty and delicious for my own good) and butternut squash cubes. We watch some YouTube channels that are focused on trail running.

21:00: V gets his cat medication

22:00: Bed time, after getting through more of The Nightingale. 

Day One: **$0**

08:30: Wake up, check phone. I make a double espresso, plus Eggo waffles with peanut butter, and settle into my book. I find out that my one cat likes to eat peanut butter, when I catch him trying to steal my eggo. I then sob into my book, at the end, and am so happy that I read it. I am interested to see if any of it lines up with any real history, so maybe I’ll look into it soon. 

10:40: Watched a little bit of my favorite running channel, Run Steep Get High, and the founder of the channel is running a marathon distance on a helipad. Gotta get the miles in somehow, right? Also, I logged onto the “T-Mobile Tuesdays” app and found out that their promotion is a free year-long subscription to a Hearst brand magazine! I got my favorite magazine, Country Living. 

11:30: I do a 10-mile run with 1500 feet of elevation gain on the roads, which is pretty good! I explored a neighborhood that I have not been to before, due to avoiding the pavement. The weather is great and fresh, and I am happy.

14:00: My husband, J, and I go to Safeway. It’s not too crowded, and it’s randomly out of eggs. I see a lot of people wearing N95 and paper masks and gloves. We just get our grocery shopping done and are out in 30 minutes. We get: White rice, coconut milk, curry paste, sweet peas, salt, 2 cadbury eggs, 3 bags of Reese’s eggs (they are our favorite and we freeze them), garbanzo beans, sour cream Ritz crackers, BBQ Ritz crackers, strawberry fig bars, a 12-pack of coke, three Aha! Fizzy waters, a 6-pack of mini ginger ales, apple sauce, pumpkin puree, 2 Rockstar energy drinks, orange marmalade, stain remover spray for laundry, string cheese, provolone cheese, cheddar cheese, a gallon of milk, tater tots, light cottage cheese, yogurt, hamburger buns, ground beef, broccoli, blueberries, 1 lime, ginger root, bananas, 2 avocados, 5 nectarines, 2 Perfect bars, one bottle of Band of Roses rose, and one bottle of my favorite rose, Miraval! Phew. We are making everything at home, and it’s a lot. Total: $191.78

18:00 J makes dinner; we have cheeseburgers and tater tots with a glass of rose. I swear I eat healthy some of the time, haha. We end up watching a movie about the Western States 100 race and then I start a book, “The Vacationers”. I’m going to get all of these unread books read during this shelter in place!

21:00 Immunosuppression V. Thank god for whoever invented the Pill Popper.

22:00: Snooooooooze.

**Day 2: $191.78**

**Day 3**

08:00: Wake up, browse stuff. I got paid today, woo hoo!  Get out of bed, have a fizzy water and an Eggo. No coffee for me until tonight when I go to work. I browse Madewell’s website and see that their jeans are on sale for $75 each! I put them in my bag and then log off. Virtual version of window shopping :)

10:00: Walk the rent payment over to the drop box  and start my run. The rent box is duct taped open, and I appreciate that I don’t have to touch it.  J and I split the rent in different ways; I pay $1830 and he pays $1400, commensurate to our salaries. **$3230.00**

11:00: 4 miles (oh so slowly) done, hop into the shower and wash my hair for the first time in a few days. I am super blonde and I am trying to preserve the dye as much as I can by not washing as much. I miss my hairstylist!

11:30: I pay our water/sewer/garbage bill via the phone. The company is not run very well, and there were several times in the last year when my payments did not go through online, nor did they go through via the mail. This is the only way that I know it’ll get done. **$162.62**

12:00: Get back into bed for a few-hour nap. I’m worried about my mom;  She is a nurse in a different state. She was told that there were no hours for her (since she works in occupational health-doing things like fitting people for N95 masks, giving flu vaccinations, etc), but they won’t fire her, so she can’t file for unemployment. I’m quite worried and trying to think about how I can help them financially. Ugh. 

15:00 Wake up after having a nightmare that one of my cats died. I never have dreams or nightmares during this nap, so it’s weird. I wake up, sautee some eggplant with parmesan cheese on top. Almost an eggplant parm. 

18:00: I leave for work. I’ve majorly adjusted what I bring with me; I only bring my license and one credit card, in a ziploc bag. I bring an extra pair of clothes to change into after work. I bring my lunch in a disposable bag, using disposable utensils (I have reusable ones I normally use), and don’t bring in my water bottle or coffee mug. I bring my keys without keychains, with just a car key and house key. Leave my sunglasses and glasses in the car (always bring my glasses in case my contacts go bad). I also put sandals in my car to wear while driving. 

22:00 Eat some pumpkin curry on my lunch break, and buy a Cherry Diet Coke from the cafe downstairs. **$1.37**

**02:00** I am hungry and sleepy so I grab some jalapeño pop corners and a diet Dr Pepper. My pt is “critically stable” and requires the care of two nurses, so we just split all of the responsibilities all night. Do vital signs, dialysis numbers every hour, multiple device numbers every hour (the pt is on a few supportive devices), labs, etc.  Total $3.10

04:30 Long break zzzz

07:45 Get home from work. Usually it takes me about an hour to get home, but during Covid times, it’s a solid 28 minutes. If I’ve got to be at work, I’ll surely take this as a consolation prize. I wipe down my car with bleach wipes, as well as my phone, name badge, keys, and air pods. Then I throw my scrubs in the wash (already changed into sweats before I left the hospital) and take a shower and scrub myself clean. 

09:00 good night. 

Day Three total: $3.397.09. Oy. 

**Day 4** 

16:45: Wake up a little earlier than I had planned, shower, drink coffee, watch news with my husband.

18:00:Drive to work, no traffic, yay

19:00: Start work, with the same patient. Do hand off with day shift nurses, check off the 10-ish IV drips that are running, plus the dialysis machine, and 3 other supportive devices that the patient is on. Same partner to take care of the patient, and we settle into our respective tasks for the night.

21:30: Our delivery boba order arrived! We ordered from Little Sweet, which their flavors are OK but I want to try a new place next time. Our unit is full of boba fans, so we usually end up ordering like 10 at a time. I order a Rose High Mountain Tea with added boba & 25% sweet. $8.18 for tip/delivery fee

0200: Fairly busy night, but glad to be at work. Still feeling very cautious and scared about COVID. My hospital requires us to wear paper masks while we are at work, to try and minimize everyone making each other sick. My loops start to really hurt my ears :(

04:30: Break time! I go to the snack machine and get a Diet Dr. Pepper and jalapeno pop corners again. $3.10

07:00 Drive home, yay!

09:00: ZzZzZz

Daily total: $11.28

**Day 5**

**16:30** : Wake up for work, shower again, and get dinner ready. I put on some casual clothes and put my dinner into disposable packaging (Bay Area cringe, so used to reusing haha). Brew a Nespresso coffee and drive to work. 

**18:45:** Fill out my pre-work questionnaire. It asks if I have had any symptoms, traveled, or had contact with any Covid + people. Also they’ve added the question if we work with immunocompromised patients, which I do (heart and lung transplants). I pass and go into work, collecting my one paper mask that I will wear for 12 hours. I get changed into hospital scrubs and start my last shift of the week. 

22:00 Dinner time! We were surprised by a local Berkeley bakery, Starter Bakery. They’ve donated a ton of fresh baked goods and I almost tear up when I eat my pain au chocolat. It’s so kind of them to think of us, and on night shift, at that! We get forgotten sometimes. 

04:30 : Break time. I have made a headband to attach my mask to, since I am getting sores on the back of my ears. It helps a lot. 

07:00: Drive home, get into a fight with my husband as soon as I get home. It’s my fault, since I’m extra snappy these days (I don’t want to be) and then we make up and I take a bath and go to bed. 

(Cutting this off as Day 5, since I was off of work at that time). 

Day 5 total: $0

**Day Six:**

**14:00** Wake up and drink a Coke to pep me up. I make a lunch of cottage cheese, a peach, and some hamburger buns with peanut butter and jelly (I want to use all of our food). Do some laundry, and give our cat his multiple medications. 

16:00 I watch a few videos about Covid, that cite a study done in Wuhan, in the hospitals and public spaces. The evidence suggests that the virus is both airborne and droplet. Yay. :/ (not actually a yay). 

17:00: Start a 4.5 hour long happy hour with J’s fraternity brothers and their spouses. We are spread all across the country and don’t get to see each other often, and I forget how much I miss all of them. We talk about everything and everyone brings their pets out (we show off our cats!). We make a pizza and drink a 32 oz crowler (can growler, I never heard of it before), aptly titled Social Media Distancing IPA, from Blue Oak Brewing. Fall asleep at 22:00. 

Day 6: $0

Day 7: 

0945: Slept with some random dreams, but for a loooong time. Switching back to daylight hours is hard, and it’s been a little easier with our current shelter in place order, since I don’t have anywhere to be. 

11:00 I made a pot of Prestogeorge’s Organic Haitian Blue coffee (from Pittsburgh, PA-check them out!) and eat a cinnamon roll. Browse YouTube and watch a Vanity Fair interview with Kim Kardashian, about the prison reform work and what she’s involved in. I’m no Kardashian fan, but I was impressed and glad that something good is coming from it. 

12:00 Start on my 6-mile trail run. It’s pouring rain and that really keeps the extra people off of the trails. It’s been making me so sad to avoid the trails, but I know that they will be crowded during the day and there’s not enough places to be 6 feet apart at all times. Only one family let their kids walk towards me, without observing the 6-foot rule. Another opportunity for education. 

13:30 Bath time and a fizzy water. 

16:00: We start to watch Ozark, since I’ve heard that a lot of people are watching it. I’m feeling so-so on it, and it feels like a cheap Breaking Bad. There’s just something about it that doesn’t click for me. 

18:00: We make dinner (tacos, plus chips and guac) and log onto Zoom for a happy hour with our run club! I miss them all so much. We live in the same town and haven’t been able to see each other, due to social distancing, and it makes me sit and think about how much I really see them every week. It ends up being about 4 times per week, and they’re all such a big part of my life. We talk about running, working from home, and making bread (it’s the new popular thing!). We log off eventually and then go to bed. I’m a bit sad tonight.

Food: $207.53

Living Costs: $3230.00 (rent) and 162.62 (water, sewage, garbage)= $3394.62

Reflections:

This definitely wasn’t a normal week, at all. We didn’t go out and do anything fun, or even go to Target and browse around. Who knew that I would miss going to Target and looking at nothing?

We bought more food than we normally do, but we are obviously making every meal at home. It’s a little shocking to see the big number when you’re at the checkout, but then it makes sense after processing it all.

Work was pretty normal too, which was a relief. The world still turns and people are still really sick from non-COVID things. There were just a few more things that made it difficult to go into work (constantly wearing a mask, being questioned about symptoms) but then there was no traffic so I am going to be so grateful for that every day! 

At this time, I wasn’t feeling too cooped up or anything, but I can definitely say that I am now, while editing this. I go from feeling ok to feeling really bummed, and I think mostly everyone is like that too.","Anyone here sharing a tiny studio apartment with their significant other 24/7 now that we’re quarantined? How are you coping?

Has this pandemic made you reconsider where you’ve chosen to live? We are considering leaving NYC as soon as we’re able once things calm down as I’m no longer working anyway. Having an appropriate-sized living space as well as access to some secluded outdoor space has just bumped up majorly on my priority list.","Nope, the title is not a joke, that is very much my life. 

And when I say pay for my existence, I mean it: they take care of my full rent, utilities, car and insurance payments, gas, groceries, student loans, credit card debt, cell phone bill, nights out with friends, medical bills, prescriptions, etc...

I currently do not work and I have no means of income. 

Reading your Money Diaries truly helps me escape my terrible reality and they remind me there is a full world of happiness, successes, failures, relationships and so on beyond this world of mine. 

I love to read about those who struggle to make ends meet, but in the end they always do. They work hard and fight and advocate for what they need. Reading these diaries can sometimes make me feel incredibly guilty, but again, it really gives me hope that I can do it, too. Some day...

Sorry if this isn’t appropriate to post here, I just wanted to let people know how much more these diaries provide than a brief look into someone’s finances. They give us such insight into the lives of others. 

I will continue to read every one that is posted ♥️","I am a low-income person who is trying to - as aggressively as I can - pay down debt and build up savings. I also have a really bad habit of impulse spending in the name of “self care.” I don’t usually regret my impulse purchases, but I do have a nagging voice in the back of my mind that tells me that money would be better spent as an extra debt payment or savings contribution.

How do you balance spending on yourself vs. putting money toward long-term goals?",,"**Section One: Assets and Debt**

*Retirement Balance (and how you got there)*

*Savings Account Balance*

* General Savings Account: $106,118
* Emergency Fund: $10,000

*Investment Portfolio Balance*

* Individual Investment Portfolio: $141,022, this is diversified across a mix of stocks and bonds. Since I'm younger and have more time to ride out economic cycles its in a much riskier allocation now, but will gradually become more conservative as I get older.

* I double majored in Computer Science and Economics, and was lucky enough to have my parents pay for my education in full. I returned the favor to them by graduating in 3 years, and saving them an extra year of tuition :)

&nbsp;

**Section Two: Income**

* Main Job Monthly Take Home: $7,500

* Any Other Monthly Income Here: I get stocks from my company as part of my compensation. I sell all of them each time they vest every 3 months, which comes out to roughly $35,000 (so an additional $11,667 per month)

&nbsp;

* Savings contribution: $2,800
* Investment contribution: $3,000
* Donations/Volunteer Time: I donate pretty sporadically (as you'll see later) so I won't put a monthly figure down here, but I tend to volunteer about 25 hours/month

**Section Four: Money Diary**

Day 1

8AM: Wake up and linger in bed for another 10 minutes before I reluctantly start to get ready - I’ve always been a slow starter in the mornings. I get dressed, pack my bag, and make it out the door before immediately realizing that I forgot something at home. By the time I grab it and get back out I’ve already missed the bus to work. Sigh. I decide to make the most of it and get some free exercise by turning on a podcast (She Makes Money Moves by Glamour) and walking the 30 minutes to my office.

9:15AM: Grab a plain greek yogurt and a coconut chocolate RXBar and settle in at my desk to start the day. Tuesdays are our “no meetings” day, so it’s a great day to sit down and get stuff done uninterrupted.

11AM: Spoke too soon! Get pulled into a last minute meeting about a new experiment another team is trying to launch. I don’t mind though since I got in some solid coding beforehand, and this Product Manager is really great to work with. We make decisions about which markets we want to experiment on, and I confirm any extra eng work I need to do on my end.

11:45AM: Drop off my laptop at my desk and head to lunch. Some days I like to eat with my team, but on days like today I like to eat alone for quality *me time*. I’m lucky that my office provides meals, so I head downstairs and make a salad with greens, corn, butternut squash, brussel sprouts, baby tomatoes and salmon. This salad feels super fall to me, and I’ve been eating it on repeat over the last few weeks

2PM: Take another break and eat some cottage cheese mixed with honey and cinnamon. This probably sounds disgusting but I swear it’s a delicious snack!

2:45PM: Step out for a dentist appointment, fingers crossed its over quick. Ever since I was a kid I've never had pleasant experiences at the dentist, so I always put it off until the very last minute. I was roped into going because I kept getting ads from this platform called Opencare, which offers people in SF a bunch of incentives to go to the dentist. I held out for a while but finally caved when they offered a free $100 gift card for going.

4PM: Back at the office and I settle in to do more coding while eating a lemon fig bar. I probably eat way too many forms of “bars” but they’re a pretty prevalent snack in our office so...

6PM: Stop for the day and get changed into my running clothes. I recently decided I was going to commit to being active for at least 30 minutes a day, 5-6 times per week - this feels like the bare minimum when I look at the time I waste online. How long will this resolution last? Only time will tell - my usual stint with healthy habits last for a few weeks before I regress to laziness. I run a 3 mile loop along the waterline - San Francisco can be grimy, but the Bay Bridge at night is gorgeous and makes the run worth it.

7:30PM: I make a stop at my friend’s apartment to drop off a few slices of the triple chocolate layer cake I baked for a party this past weekend. When I get home I throw some leftover veggie stir fry in the microwave for dinner, and finish the meal off with a couple of chocolate pretzels as a treat for dessert.

10PM: Shower and head to bed. I have a pretty bad habit of going on my computer and phone right before bed, so I spend another hour on Youtube and Reddit before actually going to sleep

**Daily Total: $0**

&nbsp;

Day 2

8AM: Wake up, get dressed, and blow out my hair in time to actually catch the bus today! (All buses and shared Ubers/Lyfts are covered by the commuter card provided by my employer unless I state otherwise).

9:30AM: Grab the same greek yogurt and RXBar as yesterday and start working

11AM: Pause to head off to an interview - today I’m interviewing a more senior candidate. I used to feel more nervous about doing these because I worried that senior male engineers wouldn’t take me seriously because I’m a young woman. I've definitely had some off-putting experiences, but after doing 100+ interviews I feel a lot more prepared to take whatever comes my way.

12:30PM: Finally done! The interview ran a little longer than I expected and I’m starving, so I run to the cafeteria and make my standard salad before they close up for the day (lunch ends at 1PM).

4PM: Head to my weekly therapy appointment. I started going a few months ago to address an eating disorder I struggled with for several years. While I’ve been “cured” for over 2 years now (you’re never really cured, it’s a daily battle), I figured it was time to talk about it with someone else. The first few sessions were a lot of crying and pouring out my soul, but it’s been worth it to get to where I am now - I can’t recommend therapy enough.

5PM: Finished with my appointment, I head back to the office to wrap up a few last things before taking the bus home at 6:30

7:30PM: Throw some delicata squash I sliced up this weekend into the oven as soon as I get home. As much as I love delicata, I never have the patience to wait the 45-50 minutes it takes for the squash to come out perfectly crispy, so I have to strategize. While that’s going I also steam and mash a sweet potato, and caramelize some onions to eat on the side. For dessert I eat a piece of dark chocolate with bits of orange zest in it - all in all a delicious meal!

9PM: Do a quick workout in my room following a video on YouTube, along with a few moves with my resistance band. When I first started working I used to go to this really expensive gym, but after a few months of the $180/month charge on my card I decided I could be equally fit for free if I put in a bit of effort.

10PM: Wash my face and moisturize, put on a kettle, and snuggle up in my bed with a mug of chamomile  tea and an episode of the Great British Bake Off

**Daily Total: $0**
 
&nbsp;

Day 3

8AM: Standard morning routine - I’m also pleasantly surprised to see that my roommate took out the compost this morning! Since it’s not too chilly I decide to walk to work again and pop on a podcast to listen to (Love Letters by the Boston Globe)

9AM: Settle in with some breakfast and immediately start working. I need to meet a deadline by the end of this week so I’ve been a little stressed, but I think I should be able to get everything I need done by today unless something unforeseen comes up.

12PM: The morning flies by and I’m surprised that it’s lunch already - that always happens when I get fully sucked into coding. Pop down to the cafeteria and decide to take a break from my usual salad. I grab a bowl of sweet potato curry with green beans, along with a piece of salmon. The curry is bomb - I wonder if the chefs would give me the recipe if I asked? (Update: they did!)

1PM: Finally deployed my code to production and things look good! I make a couple of notes of things to follow up on for the next deploy, but overall elated to get things done a day early!

2:30PM: Head to another meeting about an experiment we’re trying to launch around the holidays. This relies directly on the code I launched earlier today, so since that’s done this meeting ends up being pretty smooth and to the point. Afterwards I head to a couch near my desk area to work on other tasks for the week. Munch on some chocolate covered pretzels and drink kombucha as I work.

5:30PM: Finally done for the day, I pack up and hop on the bus to go back home. Once I get inside I quickly chop up half an onion and toss it in a pan to slowly caramelize, and cut up a sweet potato to roast in the oven. Enjoy dinner while catching up on my YouTube subscription box, and polish everything off with a few squares of dark chocolate.

7:30PM: I love music and have been trying to sing and play as much as I can in my spare time - tonight I spend an hour with my keyboard learning a song off of a YouTube tutorial. Make a bit of progress but I know I’ll have to keep practicing this for several weeks to get to a good point. Luckily the video creator included sheet music in their description, so I download that to use for practice later.

**Daily Total: $0**

&nbsp;

Day 4

8AM: Wake up feeling really lazy - I spend the first 20 minutes of the morning in bed watching videos about Thanksgiving recipes lol. Finally drag myself out of bed to get ready, and catch the bus to go to work.

9:30AM: Fridays are notoriously slow at my job, which is always a nice change of pace from the franticness throughout the rest of the week. Once I get in I make some tea and read the morning news until our weekly wrap up meeting at 10.

11AM: Get a bit more work done before popping out for lunch a bit earlier than usual. Umami Burger (a small burger chain in the US) is giving away free burgers and fries all day today, so I’m willing to take the 10 minute bus ride to get there. Meet my friend who alerted me to the deal in the first place, and get a California burger with truffle fries.

12PM: Get back to the office and spend the next few hours coding

2PM: Step away to go conduct a couple more interviews. I always feel bad saying no to interview requests, so I think the recruiters know they can rely on me to always be available. I don’t mind doing them but it’s definitely a big time suck. Today I have two back to back ones that’ll go for the next 2 hours.

4PM: Finally finished! I say bye to my last candidate and head back to my desk to write up all of my feedback for them. Once I’m done with that I leave the office for the day and talk to my older sister on the phone while I walk to the grocery store

5:30PM: I’m going to a potluck on Sunday night and volunteered to bring dessert: an apple pie and a pecan pie. I have a lot of the dry goods I need at home but need to pick up a few more things (butter, pecans, apples, heavy cream, eggs, light brown sugar) at Target and Trader Joe’s (**$17.49**)

7PM: Immediately change into comfortable clothes as soon as I get home and put on a kettle for some tea. I chat with one of my roommates a bit as she eats dinner about plans for the holidays and upcoming travel. 

**Daily Total: $17.49**

&nbsp;

Day 5

9:30AM: Up a bit later than usual since its Saturday. I make a bowl of oatmeal with a mashed banana and homemade blueberry jam for breakfast, and talk with my other roommate a bit as she makes her own breakfast. She just recently moved to the city from a small town, and the pace of life here has been a pretty big change for her.

12PM: Head to an ice cream shop in the Mission where a pop-up is giving away free scoops ice cream! My weeks don’t normally have this much free stuff, but I’m not complaining about burgers and ice cream. By the time I get there the line isn’t too long at all, and I’m in and out within 10 minutes.

1PM: Head west towards Valencia Street to do a little thrift shopping at Buffalo Exchange. I recently traded in some clothes and want to use my credit, but I come up empty handed this time. I head next door to a pizza place for a slice (**$3.00**) and bump into a friend there. I end up going over to his apartment since he lives nearby and we hangout for a bit on his rooftop.

3PM: Need to get a few more things for baking that I couldn’t find yesterday. I walk to a co-op that carries pretty much everything you could imagine, and manage to find the rest of my stuff there (**$7.79**)

4:30PM: By the time I get back home I’m exhausted from having walked everywhere. Put all my stuff away and nap for a few hours

6:30PM: I wake up feeling so much better - naps are truly the best. Head to the kitchen to start prepping dough for my pie crusts. I like making these the day before so that there’s less work the day of, and also so that the butter has the chance to firm up again and make the crusts extra flaky.

8PM: Chat with my mom for a bit before taking a shower and settling in for the night

**Daily Total: $10.79**

&nbsp;

Day 6

10:30AM: Up a lot later than usual. I linger in bed for a bit before getting up and making myself some oatmeal with mashed banana and honey for breakfast. I realize that the rest of my bananas will need to be eaten or used within the next day or so before I leave for vacation. I survey what I have in my pantry and realize I can make banana bread muffins to eat/freeze for later. Spend the rest of the morning whipping those up.

2PM: Pie time! I pull out my two discs of dough from the fridge and start working to roll them out, shape them into crusts, and blind bake them to prevent soggy bottoms. While those bake off I start working on the two fillings for them. Nearly burn the pecans when I’m toasting them but I save them at the last minute

5PM: Both pies are finally done baking and cooling on racks, which gives me just enough time to get ready. Quickly change out of my now-floured baking clothes into a pair of jeans, a comfy long sleeved sweater, and my trusty black chelsea boots that I’ve worn into the ground at this point. Grab both pies and take the bus to my friend’s place.

9PM: The potluck was great and I stay afterwards to help my friend do dishes and clean up. Thankfully both of my pies were fully eaten so I don’t have to take the leftovers home and slowly eat them myself. We chat as we do the dishes and eventually FaceTime some of our friends from college to catch up on random stuff (jobs, terrible Tinder dates, etc.)

11:00PM: Take an Uberpool back to my place - I’m exhausted. I quickly shower, brush my teeth, attempt to blow out my hair (this actually goes better than expected given how wet my hair is), and go to bed

**Daily Total: $0**

&nbsp;

Day 7

8AM: Up at the usual time for work and realize that it’s a stock vesting day for my company! I immediately pull up my brokerage account and sell off all of my shares that became available today (about ~$35k worth). I re-invest nearly all of it into my diversified portfolio but keep $1200 in cash. This is all done on my brokerage firm’s app within 10 minutes, and I spend the rest of the morning getting ready and heading into work.

9:30AM: You know the drill, greek yogurt and an RXBar for breakfast, followed by our team’s weekly stand up/planning meeting. I spend the rest of the morning working on smaller tasks and syncing up with other engineers on ongoing projects we’re working on together.

11:30AM: Head to the cafeteria to grab the usual salad for lunch, find a spot in the quieter part of the office, and open up my laptop. Now that I have the means I'm trying to be more generous and intentional in my giving. One of my best friends from high school is a teacher and has a fundraiser going to purchase school supplies for all of the classrooms for the grade she teaches because the district she works in has such little funding. It feels great to hit the “Fully Fund This Project” button and know that this money is going to something and someone who will make a difference (**$1200**)

4:30PM: The rest of the day goes by pretty normally - I knock out a few bugs, reverse shadow an interview for an engineer who just joined (a process where I observe the interview being conducted by the new engineer and give them feedback on how to improve), and close out a few tasks. At 4:30 I grab my stuff and basically sprint out the door to catch a bus to my volunteering gig.

5PM: Make it just in time! I volunteer at a non profit that offers cooking classes in low income areas or areas where there are food deserts. We ultimately want to teach and empower people in these areas so that they feel capable of cooking healthy and delicious food. I try to volunteer once or twice a week, I’d love to come more but the shifts can be pretty draining (they go from 5-11PM). I quickly change into my kitchen shoes, throw on an apron, and start to mise out ingredients.

11PM: Class went great - today we taught Vegetarian Weeknight Basics and it seemed to go over really well. That’s a fairly popular one since it’s usually much cheaper to buy vegetables over meat, and it’s equally nutritious. We clean up the kitchen, do all the dishes, and head out for the night. I catch a shared Lyft back to my place and start getting ready for bed. Volunteering is one of the best things I get to do in the city, but doing a 6 hour shift on your feet after your actual job is definitely tiring. Once I get home I quickly get ready for bed and fall asleep a few minutes after lying down.

**Daily Total: $1200**

* Transport: $0
* Other: $1200
* Total: $1228.28

I'd say this was a pretty normal week for me, except for the donation. I mentioned this a bit in my diary but I'm trying to help those around me who are trying to make a positive impact, so as I see opportunities arise I help out here and there.

I think overall I'm not really a big spender and I never have been. I grew up well off and have definitely benefitted from that (no student loan debt was a huge boost), but at the same time my parents always wanted to make sure that my sister and I weren't spoiled and respected money, which I think was a big factor in my mindset today. My current goal is to hit $1m at 25, so the saving and investing is all very intentional. I don't see myself working in tech forever, so I also have that number in mind to save as a nest egg, that way I don't have to worry about money too much when I'm looking for totally different jobs (any recs on cool jobs? I was thinking a baker because I'd love to really perfect my pie technique :)","

**Day One** 

**7:43 a.m.** – I abruptly come to my senses to the loud voice of Google Home and it takes me a couple of seconds to comprehend what happened. My husband R., is not in bed and has been raving for the last two days about a yoga class he wants to start today, so I assume that’s where he went. The sudden awakening of Google Home when there’s no one should bother me, but I am too drowsy to care and go back to sleep.

**8:20 a.m.** – I get out of bed and proceed to heat a cup of water in the microwave. I have a glass of warm water first thing in the morning, sometimes with lemon. It is a habit that R. helped me develop in the past year and I have started looking forward to it. I browse through Facebook while sipping on my water. R. is back and asks me to pack his lunch for him which is some left-over Chicken Biryani and Shrimp Fry from the fridge.

**9:00 a.m.** – R. leaves for work and I settle down on the couch browsing through Amazon, not wanting to go into work.  

**9:30 a.m**. – Finally manage to pull myself up from the couch and toast two slices of bread for breakfast. Pack my lunch which is Oats, left over chicken fry, Sambar (Indian Lentil Soup packed with Veggies) and plain yogurt. I also thrown in an apple for a snack. Eat my toast and pop in the shower.

**10:00 a.m.** \-  I get ready and start for work on my motor bike. R. and I own one motor bike each apart from the car and mostly use them to commute to work as navigating a bike is quicker and easier than a car in the chaos of traffic that defines India. Mine is a gift from my Dad (Thanks, Dad!) and R.’s is a gift from me for which I paid in full. I reach work in 30 minutes.

**10:30 a.m.** \-  Reach my desk and find the floor almost empty. Typical IT work hours in India are 11:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. to have some overlap with the other side of the world. I quickly check my emails (Yay, nothing that needs attention) and proceed to the break out area floor for some Green Tea and fill up my water bottle.

**11:00 a.m.** \-  Not much work to be done today as the client was out all last week as well, so I don’t mind that the team is not in yet. I am idly browsing Money Diaries and enjoying my Green Tea when my Manager shows up. He is juggling two projects and hence sits on a different floor now, which has both its pros and cons. He lists down some random tasks and asks me to get the team cracking on them. 

**11:30 a.m.** \-  I have a short conference call with the team that is spread across locations and explain what needs to be done. This is a new team that was formed recently for a new client engagement and we don’t know each other that well yet. I am hoping that will change soon.

**12:30 p.m.** \- I start to feel hungry but put off lunch for a little later. If I have lunch too early, I end up being hungry again around 3:00 p.m. and tend to binge on something unhealthy. Instead, I focus on setting up some meeting invites and sending out a few emails. 

**1:00 p.m.** \- Head to the breakout area on my floor to have lunch. My office has a huge 2-floor cafeteria with vendors serving food across cuisines, but I prefer having my lunch alone in peace on my floor, whenever I get lunch from home. I cook the Instant Oats with hot water in the microwave and proceed to enjoy it with my Chicken and Sambar while browsing Netflix. My cousin calls to ask about what kind of ceiling lights to pick for her new apartment and I tell her whatever I know.

**2:00 p.m.** \- I decide to go down for a walk. Not so long ago, I put myself on a strict exercise and diet regime. Long story short, I lost close to 20 pounds in 3 months and was feeling great about myself. Then, I fell off the wagon, and gained 4 pounds. Today is my first day back to a relatively less carb diet and no-so-brisk walking. Wish me luck! 

**3:00 p.m.** \- Login to my Bank Account and see that Interest for the last quarter has been credited to both my accounts ($145)! I like to see money in the bank and am against investing everything and not seeing anything in the bank. R. calls it bad financial sense, but I sleep better when I see money in the bank. 

**3:15 p.m.** \- I start working on some documentation, but immediately get distracted when I receive a notification that my Amazon parcels have been delivered. I have been looking for ways to repurpose an old shoe rack and ordered some colorful tile stickers along with a Veneer sheet on Amazon. Now that they’re here, I start scrolling through Pinterest. 

**4:30 p.m.** \- Spend time talking to a few colleagues about work that needs to be done this week. I randomly browse around for home décor stuff and pack up when the clock hits 4:30. I text R. that I will be home soon and to be ready for a walk. R. has staggered work hours (3-hour break between work hours) as his boss feels it gives employees more time to spend with family. I’m trying to see if I can align to R.’s timings so that we can spend quality time together.

**5:15 p.m.** \-  I reach home and change into work out gear. I am super hungry, so I dish out some chilled fruit custard that my sister’s MIL brought us earlier in the week. It’s delish! We head downstairs for a walk. 

**6:00 p.m.** \- Finish our walk. We live in a 22-acre gated Apartment Community that has close to 2000 condos and as a result, is very vibrant. It is a great happening place to live, right in the center of the Technology District and yet not chaotic. All these reasons led us to invest in a condo here last year and we love it.

**6:15 p.m.** \- Stop by my sister’s place to pick up my Amazon packages and R.’ Flipkart packages. My sister’s family lives 4 floors below us and it’s wonderful to have family live so close. We chat with her a bit, admire my 7-year-old nephew’s art and ask her live in help to make Roti (Indian flatbread) for us for dinner. The plan is to have them with the left-over Chicken curry we have in the fridge. I am too lazy to cook today.

**6:30 p.m.** \- We excitedly open our packages and R. tries on his new shoes while I check if the stick-on tiles match the shoe rack. We admire each other’s purchases for a while and exchange opinions. I am still hungry, so I grab some Trail Mix.

**7:00 p.m.** \- I logon to my computer for a conference call but no one joins. I stay on the call for 10 minutes, then happily log off and turn on the TV, waiting for a call from my sister to pick up dinner. I typically have conference calls from 7:00 pm to 10:00 pm.

**7:30 p.m.** \-  The doorbell rings and it’s the help with dinner! I thank her and heat up the Chicken curry in the microwave. R. is on a conference call, so I hand him his dinner and proceed to eat mine while watching ‘Aloha’ on Netflix. The movie drags on, but I love Bradley Cooper!

**8:30 p.m.** \- I turn to do the dishes, which is quite rare. My house keeper is out of town for a couple of days and I have been putting off dishes from last night, so I turn on my iPad and finish scrubbing them. I then grab another small bowl of custard, curl up on the couch and finish my movie. 

**9:30 p.m.** \- The movie is done, but R. is still on his conference call. I decide to browse through the internet for some Home Décor. We moved into our home over a year ago, but I haven’t completely decorated it yet. I like to take time and do it by wall, so that I have time to contemplate and don’t end up buying stuff I don’t need. 

**10:10 p.m.** \- I randomly switch between browsing on my laptop and scrolling through Facebook on my phone, but don’t get anything done. R. says he is done with his call, so I shut down my laptop and get into bed. I set an alarm for 7:00 a.m. and check my Fitbit. It says I finished 10k steps after a long time, so I doze off feeling elated.

**Daily Total: $0**

**Day Two:**

**7:00 a.m. -** The alarm goes off and I lounge around in bed for a while, checking my phone. I think about my uncle, who unexpectedly passed away last year on this day. He’s been on my mind for a few days, so I struggle for a while with the memories.

**7:15 a.m. -** I must cook today, so I finally get out bed and get to my warm water routine. I put some rice on the stove for R.’s lunch & dinner and soak Millets before cooking them (for my lunch & dinner). We are almost out of leftovers, so I boil some potatoes and chop veggies to make a potato stir fry. 

**8:30 a.m. -** I hop onto a conference call and wrap it up in 20 mins. Lots of action items today at work, so I prepare myself for a busy day. The potatoes finish boiling, so I proceed to make the stir fry, pack R.s’ lunch (Rice and left-over chicken curry) and cook the millets that I had soaked earlier. I hand R. his lunch and send him on his way.

**9:30 a.m. -** Finally done with cooking! I quickly toast two slices of bread, add a bit of the potato stir fry and top it off with ketchup. It tastes way better than I expected it to. There is also some milk in the fridge that is about to go bad, so I make myself a cup of strong Indian filter coffee.

**10:15 a.m. -** I text with my cousins a bit to let them know I’m thinking about them and check how they’re doing today. I hop in the shower and am out in 5 minutes flat. Get ready and leave for work. 

**11:00 a.m. -** I reach office and get busy. The next thing I know, it is lunch time.

**1:00 p.m. -** I head to the breakout area and heat up my lunch in the microwave. I start watching Tidying up with Marie Kondo on Netflix. I get hooked but cannot watch for more than 15 minutes as I have many deliverables today.

**1:20 p.m. -** Get back to work and wrap up some priority items by 2:50 p.m. Assign a few tasks to the team and talk to a couple of colleagues. Its nice outside, so I head downstairs for a walk.

**3:25 p.m. -** Finish a 30-minute walk and head back upstairs for a conference call. Stop by the in-house bistro on the way and see that they have banana cake slices that R. loves. I buy two and pay with my prepaid food card. **$1.30**

**3:30 p.m. -** I mute the conference call, grab a green tea from the breakout area and have it with a piece of the banana cake I just bought while getting some work done.

**5:00 p.m. -** I pack up and head home. On the way, I stop to pick up some curtains that I had dropped off for alteration last week. They were a steal at $18 and I found them in perfect condition in the As-Is section at Ikea. I bought them even though they were too long for my French door, but since I got them so cheap, I don’t mind the extra effort to get them altered. I pay cash from my wallet as it is a tiny hole in the wall store. **$2.85**

**5:30 p.m. -** I reach home and R. is already waiting for me. We share the left-over piece of the Banana cake and R. thinks it’s too fudgy today, so I polish it off. So much for getting back to a healthy diet. The sweetheart that he is, R. then hangs up the curtains right away for me to see. We realize that they have been cut a little shorter than we wanted them to be, but luckily it is an easy fix. We admire the curtains and head downstairs for a walk.

**6:40 p.m. -** We finish our walk and head to the in-house Supermarket to grab some stuff. We get eggs and a pack of Ready to eat Parottas (A type of flaky Indian bread). R. pays with his prepaid food card.

**7:00 p.m. -** I join a conference call and thankfully, its short. I run into the shower and am back in 10 minutes, just in time for my next meeting.

**7:30 p.m. -** The marathon meeting begins. Since it’s a new engagement, we currently have daily meetings from 7:30 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. It’s hard, but thankfully temporary. 

**8:00 p.m. -** R. is in a meeting as well, so I go to the kitchen with my laptop and start heating the Parottas on a pan. Also pop the Potato stir fry in the microwave and dinner’s ready. I focus on the call while I eat and ask R to clear the kitchen counter and put away the dishes.

**9:30 p.m. -** It’s been 2 hours on the call and I’m starting to tune out, so I log on to Amazon and start adding stuff that I need to the cart. Between the 1st and 3rd of every month, Amazon has a Pantry sale and a 15% cashback offer, with a max limit of $10. Since it’s just the two of us, I order household supplies once every 3 months and it works out great since prices on Amazon are lower than retail and considering the cashback, we get everything at a great price. I add cleaning supplies, toilet paper, toothpaste, soaps, shampoo, facial tissues, trash bags, mouth wash, deodorant, paper towels and some dry groceries.  The total comes to $57.68 and I pay using my debit card. I will receive a cashback of $8.5 in the form of Amazon pay balance in a couple of days. **$57.68**

**10:30 p.m. -** I am almost done fixing one of the curtains and dozing off when the meeting is done! I put on a face mask and set the alarm for 8:00 a.m. Check my Fitbit (13,000 steps today, yay!) and crash.

**Daily Total: $61.83**

**Day 3:**

**7:57 a.m. -** Wake up to the sound of the doorbell. My house keeper is back in town! R. is nowhere to be found so I can’t go back to bed. I freshen up and have my warm water. 

**8:30 a.m. -** Instruct the house keeper to finish some pending tasks. She comes in daily at 7:00 a.m. and dusts and cleans the condo, folds the laundry, chops the veggies I lay out and does the beds, the dishes and the bathrooms. Log on to my computer to join a conference call. R. comes back from Yoga and leaves to work, all while I am on the call. He usually has lunch with friends on Fridays and we order in on Friday nights, so I don’t cook today.

**9:30 a.m. -** Breakfast is toast with left over potato stir fry and Indian filter coffee. I watch a bit of Tidying Up with Marie Kondo and contemplate clearing out my 3 overflowing closets.

**10:30 a.m. -** Pack my lunch (Millets & leftover chicken curry) and start to work. The traffic is a mile long at the light and I have a team meeting at 11:00, so I take a detour and reach way ahead than I expect to. Maybe I should stick to this route from now on.

**11:00 a.m. -** Attend the meeting and get to work. My manager sends me an IM around 12:30 asking if I want to have lunch together and I suggest meeting at 1:15 p.m.

**1:15 p.m. -** I don’t really feel like eating the lunch I brought, so I head down to the cafeteria with my manager and another colleague. There’s a long queue and it takes me 20 minutes to get my chicken pizza from the Italian Counter using my debit card. I don’t like it as the crust is under baked and make a mental note to never eat it again. On a different note, I don’t use credit cards as it feels like spending money that I don’t have. I do have an Amex from work for work related expenses and another add-on Amex that R. insists I carry, but I only use them once or twice a year for shopping or travel offers. **$1.64**

**2:10 p.m. -** Get back to my desk and start reviewing some documents, but my manager asks me to work on an urgent presentation, so the rest of the afternoon slips away. I get some green tea and eat an Indian berry and a plum I got from home to keep me going. No time today for a walk around the office.

**5:05 p.m. -** I email the presentation to my manager and walk out, when he shows up and tells me to scrap what he told me earlier and work on an entirely different presentation. Gaaah .. what a waste of time and productivity. I tell him I will work on it at home and rush down to the parking since I am already late. Text my sister and ask if she wants to join R. and I for a walk and she obliges.

**5:25 p.m. -** Reach home in 20 mins flat. R. is already home, so we share a piece of the banana cake from yesterday and head downstairs for a walk. We stop by my sister’s floor on the way and all of us go down together. The walk is fun, and I hardly notice how much I walk. My sister has a colleague’s family coming over for dinner tomorrow, and we discuss the food. 

**6:45 p.m. -** Back home from the walk, freshen up and eat a few cashews for energy.

**7:00 p.m. -** My conference call begins and my manager IM’s me that he no longer needs what he asked for earlier. Phew! R. starts pestering me about what to order for dinner. Every Friday night, he takes forever to decide and keeps picking my brain. Perks of marriage. I tell him to order whatever he likes and leave me alone. He obliges for once and orders a new kind of Biryani. There is a 30% cashback offer on orders paid through Amazon Pay so he uses that and pays $5.

**8:00 p.m. -** The laundry guy comes home to drop off clothes that he had picked up for pressing earlier this week. Its 8 cents per piece and the total comes to $4.05. I pay cash. **$4.05**

**8:30 p.m. -** The food arrives, and I am famished, so I don’t wait for R. and proceed to eat. I pop open a can of Thums Up for us to share. (A coke-like Soda sold by Coke, exclusively in India) We are both usually on different conference calls, so we don’t try to have dinner together. I work on fixing the second curtain while listening in on the call.

**9:30 p.m. -** Done with my meeting. The curtains are finally fixed, and I have R. hang them up. They are the perfect length now, so I’m glad my effort has paid off. I watch Marie Kondo on Netflix on the TV and R. watches some violent show on the Home Theatre.

**11:00 p.m. -** We decide it’s time to sleep and compare our Fitbit stats. (10k steps today). We’re very tired and fall right asleep. 

**Daily Total: $5.69**

**Day 4:**

**8:30 a.m. -** It’s Saturday and thankfully my house keeper is late today, so we sleep in and wake to her ringing the doorbell. I lay out vegetables for her to chop while having my warm water with lemon. I then pour some steamed rice cake batter into molds and put them on the stove for breakfast. This dish is called Idli and is a South Indian delicacy.

**9:00 a.m. -** The rice cakes are done, and I proceed to make pepper mushroom stir fry for lunch. I am too lazy to cook the other dish I had vegetables chopped for, so I put them in the fridge. My cousin who lives in New Jersey video calls me on WhatsApp, and I talk to her while cooking. She tells me all about her recent 2-week trip across Nevada, Arizona and California and I am hit with a massive bout of nostalgia about the time I went on that trip over 2 years ago while living in the US.

**10:00 a.m. -** R. and I finish our breakfast and the mushroom is so delicious, we finish most of that too. We watch TV for a while and R. browses Amazon for a badminton racquet. He wants to start playing**.** 

**11:00 a.m. -** We decide to head to Decathlon, a huge sporting goods store that is quite far. I’ve been eyeing a pair store brand sandals for a long time and R. wants to buy his racquet and some non-marking shoes, so we get ready and out onto the road in our car. R. asks me to drive but I am not in the mood, so he has no option but to take the wheel. 

**12:00 p.m. -** We reach the store and walk through the aisles. Spend quite a bit of time and end up and the billing counter with a pair of Sandals and a sports bra for me and two polo’s and a set of badminton racquets for R. I notice the racquets are quite expensive and advanced for a beginner like R. We debate for a while and I promise to buy it for him if he plays regularly, so he chooses an intermediate level racquet that is 1/4th the price of the set. My brother in law texts me to get him a zipper shirt, so I pick that up as well. The total comes to $66.85 and I pay with my debit card. My sister will pay me back later for the shirt. **$66.85**

**2:00 p.m. -** We’re starving and wondering what to eat, when we see a small kiosk serving food right outside the store. Head there and order some egg noodles, fries and a soda. It’s over a hundred degrees and the kiosk has no shade, so we crank up the AC in the car and finish our lunch. I pay since I have my debit card handy. **$3.55**

**4:00 p.m. -** We reach home and turn on the TV but decide to take a nap instead. R. did not like the shoes in the store, so he checks online and orders the same shoes in two sizes since he is not sure on the sizing of the brand. He pays $20 and will return the pair that won’t fit. 

**5:30 p.m. -** Wake up and head downstairs for a walk in my new sandals. Someone posted rave reviews in our community’s Foodies group about a new Samosa stall that opened down the road and we decide to check it out. We walk to the stall and have two hot piping samosas each. They are delicious! There is also an Organic food store right there, so we go in and buy a pack each of millets and pumpkin seeds since we’re out of them. The total comes to $2.57 and R. pays for both

**6:15 p.m. -** We see that the vegetable and fruit vendor is in the community today, so we buy some Indian Dates and Guavas to last us the week. On the way back, we stop at the in-house supermarket to pick up Ready-to-eat Parottas, yogurt, mushrooms and eggs. R. pays. 

**6:30 p.m. -** Head back upstairs after our walk and quickly shower. My sister has a has invited us as well for dinner with her colleague’s family, so we go to their place and spend the evening there eating chicken kebabs, pizza discs and Biryani, all ordered from In House chefs living in our community and playing with the guests’ 1-year old baby girl. I drink some more Thums Up and dessert is hot brownie with Ice cream. 

**10:00 p.m. -** The guests are ready to leave but want to look around the community, so we all go downstairs to walk for a while. There is an ice cream truck and both my nephew and I want one each. R. pays through G Pay as no one has cash. We then escort the guests to their car and say bye. 

**11:00 p.m. -** We pick up my package from my sister’s place and go back home upstairs. I open the package and admire the set of beautiful wall mirrors encased in wrought iron. I ordered them last week to hang up in the balcony with a tree decal, but I am yet to order the decal. I logon to a couple of websites and order the one I want. Its $10.34 on Amazon and $2.84 on another website, so I go with the obvious choice though it will arrive a couple of days late. **$2.84**

**12:00 a.m. -** R. has already crashed so I sneak into bed and fall right asleep after turning off my alarm. Fitbit says I took 12k steps today, so yay!

**Daily Total: $73.24**

**Day 5:** 

**8:30 a.m. -** Wake to the sound of the doorbell and it doesn’t seem like R. is home so I open the door. It’s an Amazon delivery, can’t believe he came so early! Fall back into bed.

**8:45 a.m. -** The bell rings again and this time it’s the house keeper, so I wake up and lay out vegetables for her to chop. I sip on my warm water and check my messages. I remember that R. went to a spiritual discourse session today to try it out, so I think about what to eat while throwing in a load of laundry.

**9:30 a.m. -** I eat half a parotta with the leftover mushroom stir and have some Indian dates we bought yesterday. Top it off with two cups of green tea, hang up the laundry to dry and throw in another load. 

**10:30 a.m. -** Done and dusted with the cooking. I make carrot stir fry and cucumber daal. R. comes home just as I am done cooking and takes over the laundry. He also deals with the Water Purifier service rep that shows up for an appointment he booked earlier in the week. The rep says the filters have conked and will need to be replaced. We basically have no choice as the machine has been continuously beeping for a few days and ask him to go ahead. It’s worth it since the first set of filters lasted us 15 months and one cannot drink water from the tap in India. The total is $66.42 and R. pays via Google Pay as we don’t have enough cash. 

**11:30 a.m. -** I turn on a regional sitcom on the TV and sit down to work on repurposing my shoe rack with the self-adhesive tile stickers that were delivered last week. Takes me a while to decide how to do it and I ask for R. suggestions a couple of times, but it’s finally done and looks beautiful. I take a break to pop some rice on the stove for lunch. I have the perfect place for the shoe rack, but R. thinks it makes the room cluttered. We agree to disagree for the moment. 

**1:30 p.m. -** Done with lunch. R. goes into the bedroom to catch some winks, but I am too worked up about my nifty craftwork to sleep. I have quite some stickers left over, so against my better judgement, I grab a laptop stand and proceed to work over it with a veneer adhesive sheet. It gets messy, but I am very flustered by this point and just want to be done with it. It’s not as great as the shoe rack, but hey, A for effort. 

**4:30 p.m. -** The sitcom is still playing, and I pause it to get a random assortment of fruits, trail mix and green tea from the kitchen and hit play.

**5:20 p.m. -** We have a dinner to attend tonight and I don’t want to miss my exercise, so I wake R. up. He is drowsy and I make him a coffee. It works, and we head downstairs. 

**6:30 p.m. -** Done with the walk, and back home for a quick shower. I ask R. to get ready, but he is still lounging on the sofa doing nothing when I come out. He slinks off once he sees me. 

**7:20 p.m. -** We’re pooling with my sister and family, so we make a quick stop at their place, where I grab some jewelry to wear and we’re off to the dinner in their car.

**8:00 p.m. -** Reach the place, and we’re spell bound by the décor. It’s a very Indian event to celebrate a boy’s coming of age and is usually done when the kid turns 9 or 11. The kid is presented with a traditional piece of clothing called a dhoti, and he wears it for the first time in the event. Dhotis were all that were worn by adult Indian males until 2 generations ago and are still extensively worn in remote villages but are used rarely these days. It is an outdoor event at a private retreat overseeing a huge lake, and though its chilly, there are space heaters everywhere. There’s live music, an open bar, live appetizer counters and a full size main course buffet. 

**9:00 p.m. -** No one feeds guests like Indians do, and we’re all stuffed from the food. I grab a Thums Up from the bar, my sister gets some wine and we go walk around the retreat. We agree that it’s amazing and decide to host our next family party there.

**9:45 p.m. -** The dinner’s on in full swing, but we decide to have dinner and leave as my nephew is sleepy and has school tomorrow. I grab Roti, Paneer curry and some Mongolian fried rice from the live counter. It’s all delicious and there are a lot of dishes to try, but I can’t eat much and decide to move on to dessert. I try the hot crispy jalebi and tiny fruit ice cream pops that they have in different flavors and don’t stop eating until R. literally pulls me away. At this point, my nephew flops down on the grass and starts whining loudly, so we pile into the car and go home. 

**11:00 p.m. -** Reach home, change, set the alarm for 8:00 a.m. and go to bed. Pajamas are the best and the feeling of getting into them after an evening of wearing heavy Indian clothing is bliss. Check my Fitbit and its 12,000 steps for today.

**Daily Total: $0**

**Day 6** 

**7:30 a.m.** \- Wake to sound of the doorbell and open the door to my help. I freshen up and sip my warm water while browsing randomly on my phone. Put some rice on the stove and pack R.s’ lunch once it’s done. 

**8:3**0 a.m. - Logon to my laptop and join a conference call. R. leaves for work in the meanwhile. On the call, I am informed that there is no meeting scheduled for tonight as the client is out of the office, so I do a little jiggle and my help gives me a weird look.

9:30 a.m. - Make myself a couple of Chickpea flour crepes for breakfast. It’s a super easy breakfast option I stumbled upon in a Facebook Group and was amazed at its low-calorie content and ability to keep one full for a long time. I make myself some filter coffee and end my breakfast with a few Indian dates. Pack millets, cucumber daal, carrot stir fry and yogurt for lunch and throw in a Guava for a snack.

10:30 a.m. - Get ready and leave for office. Reach by 11:00 a.m. and start working since I have a lot to do today after filling my water bottle.

12:30 p.m. - Take a break and browse some travel websites on my laptop. It’s our fifth anniversary in February and I really want to go somewhere.

**1:00 p.m. -** Heat up my lunch in the microwave and eat it in the break out area while watching a regional sitcom on my laptop. 

**3:00 p.m. -** Head downstairs for a walk and read a couple of Away Game articles by Refinery 29. 

**3:45 p.m. -** Back from the walk for back to back conference calls while having some green tea along with my guava until it’s time to go home at 5:00 p.m.

**5:30 p**.**m.** \- Reach home and R. and I head downstairs for a walk. See my nephew playing downstairs in the Sand Pit so we stop to say Hi.

**7:00 p.m. -** Join an internal meeting that my colleague set up as the client sessions were cancelled and walk everyone through some documentation the team worked on today. The door bells rings and it’s a home chef in our community delivering the egg fried rice I ordered on her WhatsApp group earlier this week. My Mom calls and I chat with her a bit. I realize I haven’t talked to my parents all week and feel bad about it. I vow to call them every other day, if not every day. 

**8:10 p.m. -** My colleague must join another meeting, so he cuts short our call abruptly, but I don’t care. I hand R. his dinner and proceed to have mine while watching some videos on YouTube. The fried rice is subpar. The quantity wasn’t much, and I am still hungry, so I eat some rice with yogurt and polish it off with a small Dairy Milk I find in the fridge. I pay the lady through Paytm, an app specific to India. **$2.50**

**9:00 p.m. -** I pause the TV and start looking for flight deals. R. has a lot of reward points, so I only want to go to places that have hotels where we can use the points. I end up looking a lot and can’t decide on anything. My laptop runs out of juice and dies, so I decide to call it a day.

**11:00 p.m. -** R. and I chat for a bit about work and doze off after comparing Fitbit stats. 14,000 steps today. Woohoo!

**Daily Total: $2.50**

**Day 7:** 

**7:10 a.m. -** Wake to the sound of the doorbell and go to open the door, but R. beats me to it. He is up early as he wants to start playing badminton today. I ask the help to fold the pile of laundry from the weekend and go back to bed for a while. 

**8:00 a.m. -** Finally wake up and do my warm water routine. Join my conference call at 8:30 p.m. and kiss R. goodbye as he leaves. 

**9:00 a.m. -** Done with the call and proceed to make myself chickpea crepes and filter coffee for breakfast, and mushroom stir fry for dinner. Pack my lunch. Its millets, mushroom fry, cucumber daal and yogurt today. I also take an apple for a snack.

**10:00 a.m. -** Done with breakfast and head to work. Reach by 11:00, fill my water bottle and get down to business. Conference a few colleagues and explain what needs to be done today.

**1:00 p.m. -** Look up when I start feeling hungry and head to the break out area. Heat up my lunch and browse randomly while I finish my lunch and get back to work.

**3:00 p.m. -** Go downstairs for a 30-min walk and read another Away Game article while I walk. I wonder why I never contemplated solo travel. It sounds like so much fun. 

**3:30 p.m. -** Back to work and at it until 5:15 p.m., with a short break in between for green tea and an apple. I’m running late so I rush down to the parking.

**5:45 p.m.** \- Reach home and hurriedly drag R. down for a walk. We pop into the super market to grab some vegetables as we are totally out and get tomatoes, potatoes, onions, green chilis, tindora (an Indian vegetable) yogurt, ready-to-eat chapatis and whole wheat bread. R. pays $4.28 with his prepaid food card. I grab all of it and run upstairs while R. goes back to walking. 

**6:32 p.m. -** Join the conference a couple of minutes late, and everyone is done with the call exactly 2 minutes later. I am beyond flustered by this point.

**7:00 p.m. -** My other conference call begins, and the client is back in office, so I must focus. I heat up the chapatis for me, and the parottas for R. while listening in. Today, they’re paired with mushroom stir fry I made in the morning and left-over carrot fry from the fridge. I finish dinner and start craving dessert. I remember my sister offering a brownie over the weekend, so I text her to see if it’s still available. It is, but I cannot go downstairs due to my meeting, so I call my sister’s in house help on the intercom and request her to bring it upstairs when free.

**8:45 p.m. -** The brownie is here! R. and I share it and I get back to my meeting. I start losing focus and open random home décor and travel websites to browse. 

**10:00 p.m. -** Done with my meeting. R. and I decide that Dubai is a good option and I shortlist a few itineraries. We are at it until 11:00 p.m. when R. starts dozing off. Decide that it’s a lost cause and head to bed. 

**10:30 p.m. -** We chat for a few minutes and compare Fitbit stats. (13k steps today). It’s been a good first week back to walking. I realize R. fell asleep while talking, so I doze off as well.

**Thoughts ..**

I did not have to buy groceries or fill gas in my bike this week as I just done it the day prior. Typically, those are two standard expenses every week and come to about $25. I also usually spend more on food, and the clothes & home expenses are just things that happened to happen in this week :) .. they usually occur once in a couple of months.","I still remember the day I marched over with my pitchfork to this sub on the first day that it was created.  I have enjoyed it ever since and  wow, over 14,000 people have subbed here and probably a ton more lurkers.

Edit: June 6th - celebrated too soon.","Trying something new here, in response to this [Salary Story/Money Diary-adjacent content](https://www.thecut.com/2020/05/ive-lost-all-my-income.html) from the Cut. I thought it would be interesting to dissect the parts of this person's story that are directly related to **\*systemic\* issues and circumstances vs. \*individual\* choices and failings**. One of the major themes of the R29 comment section is everyone duking it out over these issues. Is the diarist a bad/unworthy person, did they make bad choices, or are they simply doing the best they can with what was handed to them? 

Examples of **systemic problems** include the growing income inequality, lack of real wage increases when inflation is considered, lack of affordable housing, increasing cost of education, etc.

Examples of **individual choices** around money include (to some extent) the type of work someone does, daily spending on discretionary items, creating and sticking to a budget, etc. Of course--you can boil down \*most\* individual choices, or perceived individual choices into a logical outcome from systemic issues, but I think many people believe that there is a limit--there's some line between stimulus and response where people have at least some personal culpability. Generational poverty and structural inequality, racism, sexism etc. complicate this picture...

**\*\*Onto the judging (I money diarized this a bit):\*\***

39 years old, Brooklyn, divorced, unemployed (self-employed)

* Income: Currently none, because she shut down her massage therapy/acupuncturist business on March 14th when the state went into lockdown. Says she was making ""6 figures"" before the pandemic. 
* Debt: $11,000 on a shared credit card ""from her marriage"" and $9,000 on a personal credit card. $90,000 (yes) of student debt when she went to ""graduate school for acupuncture"".
* Assets: She ""lost"" over half the money she received in her divorce settlement, which was a 401k ""worth"" about $26k. ""The Monday after I closed my business, I liquidated that portfolio because I didn’t feel comfortable leaving my money in the market. That was the same day that the Dow dropped 3,000 points — so what started out as $26,000 wound up being only about $10,000 in the end."" She says she was saving zero before. 
* She also had ""some cash from a promotional offer I did in mid-March where clients bought gift cards and packages. It’s basically a credit to be worked off later, though, so I don’t feel great about living on it."" 
* She says her total cash assets in March equaled around $40,000, and she has spent $8,000 of it so far. 
* Monthly expenses before the pandemic of around $5,000/month, now she's cut down her expenses to about $2,300/month. (ED NOTE: That doesn't really add up, because the day the Dow dropped that she references appears to be March 9th. There's a cheeky $1k more or so in there, but we all underestimate how much we spend, so I get it). 
* She lives alone with two dogs, her landlord reduced her rent by half, but she pays $850 for her office space. This office space is a sublet and the leaseholder is a ""friend"" who is not getting a break on the rent, so she is paying the full amount.
* Health insurance - now on Medicaid, previously paid for her own insurance.
* Some things she bought: $250-$300/month on grocery boxes, and one night a week takeout (no $ given). $280 on clothes, and a wine delivery subscription for $40. She was paying for therapy through BetterHelp for $400/month, but applied for their reduced fee option of $125 with no income. 

She describes a long story about applying for unemployment but experiencing huge delays due to the site not functioning and not being able to get through via phone, but finally started receiving payments on May 20th. She is receiving around $1,000/week, which strikes me as quite generous. She says they owe her $8,800 in back pay. She also applied for an Economic Injury Disaster Loan from the SBA, and received $45,000 in her bank account, but is afraid to touch it. 

**\*\*The verdict\*\***

**Systemic:**

* The fact that there is a school that is allowed to operate a ""graduate program"" for acupuncture that charges $90,000, the idea that any individual should have to take $90,000 in loans out
* Unemployment being so hard to access in the pandemic, especially in New York
* Consumer/credit card debt being so prevalent/widely extended
* No nationwide/statewide rent relief for shuttered businesses/people who have lost income
* The fact that the various types of stimulus/relief packages were extremely confusing for so many people. In particular, she was eligible for the Paycheck Protection Program, which was opened to sole proprietors on April 10th. The second tranche of PPP funding has not yet been exhausted. If she earned $100k, she would have been eligible for around $19k of PPP payments, which do NOT need to be paid back if spent on ""payroll"" (when you are self-employed, payroll is just what you pay yourself). This is in contrast to the EIDL, which is a loan, and she probably shouldn't use unless she has to. It makes sense that this was very confusing, but she potentially missed out on literal ""free money"" here. 
* (Positive systemic) Medicaid being available/expanded for low/no income people in the state of New York.
* What else?

**Individual:**

* Chaotic attitude about money - no budget, no savings, in spite of having a fairly high income and a fairly successful business
* Potentially messy divorce (divorce messes up so many people's financial lives, obviously), but she received some assets from the divorce that weren't property allocated
* Emotional spending 
* Huge student loan burden with no progress towards payback, in a field with totally variable financial outcomes. It \*seems\* like she is doing pretty well, but her loans still equal probably at least 1x her income.
* Taking her 401k out of the market when the market dropped...PLEASE EVERYONE DO NOT DO THIS. If there's any way at all that you can avoid doing this, please leave your investments in place. In this case, she had a good amount of money, and was able to access unemployment (and could have received the PPP money). The market rose again, and her money wouldn't have been ""lost"" forever. 
* What else?

What do you think about this format/these questions? (Also feel free to judge me for writing this instead of working. I'll do anything to avoid my task list, clearly...)","In my limited experience, it seems that MDers as a whole are really into their wellness routines for vanity, health, self-esteem, exercise, endorphins, whatever.  I've never seen so many mentions of skincare products in one community.  Obviously, investing money in appearance is something we do if we have the means, and it's fun to read about products, but hardly anyone that I've read (except a UK MD) mentions cosmetic procedures.  This topic is really taboo where I'm from; it's like ""Cruel Intentions""--everyone does it but nobody talks about it, which is a shame.  

Opening up the discussion:  What have you had done?  What's stopping you if you haven't?  What procedures do you recommend?  How long have you had it?  What did it cost?  Are you happy with the result?  Would you do it again?  I'm talking Botox, Dysport, lip fillers, injections, microderm abrasion, acid peels, boob job, liposuction...

I'll go first:  I started getting Botox injections years ago in my young thirties.  I get between my brows and the lines on my forehead done.  I've been getting so long now that I know exactly how I want my face to feel and the kind of expression I want left; I make sure my brows still move and don't look frozen in surprise like a Desperate Housewife.

I LOVE IT.  Since I started young, and most importantly, DIDN'T TELL A SOUL, it appears as if I've just got killer skin and great genetics.  I'm 37 now and got carded twice in the last month, whereas my younger boyfriend did not (LOL, he was so upset).  No, he doesn't know.  I didn't want to tell anyone because I never want it thrown back in my face as a catty/petty comment.  I plan to continue getting injections so I can age out like Jane Fonda.

It costs anywhere from $12-$14 a unit in my area, and I usually spend $300-$350 every 4 months.  While it seems expensive (it is), I also am not a huge clothes shopper and don't spend money on take-out or alcohol (I don't drink).  

Let's go, tell me everything.","I went down a rabbit hole recently reading New York Mag's [""What I Can't Live Without"" series](http://nymag.com/tags/what-i-can't-live-without/), which is a fascinating glimpse into what random things celebrities and 'it' people spend their money remorselessly on. (Did you know Pete Wentz of Fall Out Boy fame apparently [can't live without $170 La Mer face cream](http://nymag.com/strategist/article/pete-wentz-fall-out-boy-favorite-things.html)!?)

I started thinking about what mine would be, and I'm curious to hear from you all as well! (I guess this is just a spin on the old 'best purchases' prompt, but these don't have to be super functional or 'worth the money' — they just need to bring you endless joy or be things you'd purchase again and again.)

Here's some of what I couldn't live without:

* [Muji Linen Twill Cushion Slippers](https://www.muji.us/store/4549738704317.html) ($24) — I'm so cold-bodied, it feels like my feet would get hypothermia without these. I like how simple the silhouette is.
* [San Francisco Public Library Card](https://sfpl.org/) ($0) — I used to spend so much money on books I'd read once. Now I just spend a bunch of time in the library with decision paralysis.
* [Trader Joe's Lemon Chicken and Arugula Salad](https://www.traderjoes.com/fearless-flyer/article/4894) ($4.29) — I literally eat this salad every single weekend. Plugged it in the money diary I wrote for this sub a few months ago and still yelling about it at every chance I get.
* [Spotify Premium](https://www.spotify.com/us/premium/) ($10) — My friend once temporarily kicked me off her family plan as a joke and I signed up for my own Premium subscription pretty much *immediately*. I can't stand the ads on their platform, they're another level of awful for some reason.",I have a few different questions that are minor enough they seem silly to make a whole post of but it got me thinking that I might not be the only one to feel that way! I am Reddit new so I have no idea how to request that or if it’s even something folks would be into but I figured it was worth posing the question.,"Those Ghirardelli squares are not that small.  Maybe we are all being monsters here by calling people out for having a single square of chocolate.  I mean, I'm still going to eat 5 of them but that is me.","Edit: dammit, I meant ""Money Diary"" obviously. Thanks, autocucumber.

There's always a few things that strike me while reading the American diaries, I wondered if any of you had similar observations. How do these diaries compare to your cultures? I'll start!

- The car payments! In my country, cars are very expensive and the interest rate for a car loan is about 15%. I only know one family who bought a brand new car, and they are very well off. Most people buy second-hand cars (including second-hand imports from Japan), and often pay cash. I find it fascinating that so many money diarists have car loans and brand new cars, but I figured out eventually that their interest rates are much lower.
- The health insurance and student loan payments. I won't delve deep into this one but ummmm yeah, grateful for how things are in my country.
- The tipping! I have to visit the states for work occasionally and the tipping stresses me out. Occasionally in my country you might tip a waiter (more likely, throw some coins in a communal tip jar), but definitely not your hairdresser. I understand why they have to in the states but it seems like a dumb system to me.
- The online ordering (and returning!). This one strikes me the most--where I'm from, same day delivery isn't a thing, nor is Amazon Prime. If something doesn't fit, you often have to pay for return shipping. People ordering three things with the intent to keep one and return the rest is totally wild to me! 


Note, I'm not shitting on diarists for any of these things, I just find it interesting to observe.","Edited to say: I'm really sorry that this seemed to trigger anxiety for so many of you. That is not what I meant at all (and honestly re-reading the post, I'm not even clear what you're latching onto). I really don't think it's all that controversial to suggest that you wait a couple months until at least the initial shelter in place is over before making extremely consequential financial decisions, if those are decisions you weren't considering making before lockdown started. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I've been seeing an alarming number of posts asking for advice on whether OPs should make drastic semi/permanent life decisions right now, from quitting jobs with nothing else lined up to getting plastic surgery to moving to the suburbs. Everyone's circumstances are different but I think in general now is a really bad time to be making these kinds of decisions. Everyone is stressed out and emotional. We're all feeling cooped up. Anxiety is super high. But we are still VERY EARLY in this disaster. Most states aren't even out of shelter in place orders yet. We're looking at completely unprecedented economic devastation. If you're considering a huge life decision right now, maybe take some time to think through why you're really doing this now and whether you'd 100% feel the same way in a year. And then sit on it for two months before making any moves. ","At my bach and discussing fun activities for bachelorettes and my maid of honor goes; “Guys, I went to Austin for one and did tarot card readings by this girl who was a total riot. Pretty sure she’s a sugar baby, too”

My friend is like ????

So I begin to explain MDs and my friend shows me her instagram. It’s totally her. Safe to say I created two new MDers that day.","You asked and you have received! If your favorite part of Money Diaries is reading through what OPs eat in a week then this is the place for you!

""Women have effectively internalized the messages that our society sends them about money, and the result is that the primary emotion so many of us feel about money is shame. We feel shame when we are in debt; we feel shame because we spend too much, certainly; we feel shame because we earn too little — and we even feel shame because we earn too much. This is particularly so if women earn more than their male partners — which even today is a such a taboo that [both parties will lie to the federal government](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/17/upshot/when-wives-earn-more-than-husbands-neither-like-to-admit-it.html) about their incomes.

April 22nd, Wednesday:
1am: Wake up and realize my brother hasn’t sent me a single picture of my nieces for the day. He gets off work about the same time I head to bed, so I send him a text asking how the babies are doing. He sends me videos of Blossom playing on her cat tree and the twins, Lena and Athena, licking each other. Ugh they are so precious, I just want to snuggle them. Time to sleep againnnnnn


6:30: Time to get the social working party started! I hug my stuffies and kiss my husband’s head, then pop to it!  I volunteered for overtime since everything is super crazy, and knock out all my cases for the day before 8:45. This never happens, so I’ll take it. Positive affirmations fill my mind along with my mom’s voice saying I’m a wonderful asset in her life. 

8:50ish: I scroll through my phone and look at pictures of my Moo. Moo (my mom) passed in December, she was my bestie. I start to tear up and snuggle my stuffies. 

11:00: facetime with the broseph! Does he have a name? Who knows! When we were younger, I just called him Face. He much prefers the silly nicknames to that. He holds up the babies for me to say hi, they purr blink into the camera. He swears they act nicer after we have our morning calls, but I think he’s just being nice. I remind him to bring a raincoat and to check for his easter stationery before he goes to work. 

12:00: I have been leaving my husband alone because we mess up each other’s work flows tremendously. I bring down my baymax stuffy so he has an office mate and eat two bananas and a kiwi. Take my anti-baby and anti-sad pills, that’s what’s up 

12:15: emailssssssssssssss and phone callllllllllllllllllllsssssssssssssss
5:00pm: we did it live and we survived! Coolio. I take a four hour long nap because that’s just who I am this week. 

9:00: skincare! Cleanse, tone, brightening serum, and moisturizer, all from Glo Skin Beauty. Does any of this stuff work?
I dunno, but it makes my face smell good and sometimes that’s all a girl needs. 

Daily spend: $0



April 23rd, Thursday:

6:30am: realize no new cases were assigned to me and have a mini heart attack. Turns out, I did my entire week’s worth in a single morning. 
Decide to never tell a soul and watch What We Do in the Shadows with my husband while returning emails and doing some online Excel training. He makes me a mocha using my nespresso, Nessie. Coffee is my spirit animal


12:00: I should have guessed something insane was going to happen as soon as I decide never to tell a soul anything, our system crashed and none of my case notes saved. Super lame, but at least it’s something I enjoy doing and am quick at. Anti-sad and anti-baby pills get shoved down the gullet. 


5:00: finally finished with allllllllll of that silliness, I am so glad, wow. I spend the next few hours surfing the web for things to go into the “lol, you delusional bitch” bookmark folder. I save pretty much everything that I have my eye on for my brother, my husband, and our best family friend Super Dave. So far we have bellroy wallets and Snowe pillows along with electric toothbrushes. 

We doin it big this year. They each sacrificed a ton to try to keep me pieced together when my Moo passed, so they deserve nice things (and I know they don’t think about any of that stuff at all)

I also decide to do it big for myself and throw a Juste Un Clou into the folder, maybe my brother will win the lotto and give me half lolololololol. 
Grilled veggie kabobs and peanut butter for dinner. Not a great combo, actually. 
8:00: play hangman with bruh until he gets off work around 10ish, we hate this stupid game so much, but we play it anyway. Skincare routine, activate! 

10:00: snuggles with husband! He’s been playing with his new gaming PC, and we spend the next chunk of time daydreaming of décor for the media room. We decide on getting a love sac and a new TV. 
11:00: sleeeeeeeeeeppppp
Daily spend: $0


April 24th, Friday:
6:30am-5:00pm: nothing. Not one single email or call. Spooky. Monday will be funsies. Throw in the anti-sad and anti-baby pills at noon. 

6:00: Realize for the 27th day in a row, my husband has stolen my earbuds. We won’t be playing this game anymore, dude can keeeeepppp them. I buy AirPod Pros and have them engraved with my rap name from a name generator. It was going to be that or “stay away, Husband,” but that wouldn’t fit lol. ($271) I walk around my neighborhood for 45 minutes before I remember that I forgot to put on sunscreen. 


7:00: Have I eaten? Nope! Time for homemade bread, ayoooooooo. My husband’s new hobby brings me a ton of joy.
8:00: I conk out before I can say good night to anyone or do my skincare routine. Whoopsies. 

April 25th, Saturday:
4:00am: I’m crying and hyperventilating. I decide that positive affirmations are all well and good, but they don’t undead my mom. My husband holds me and tries to sing me to sleep. In a stroke of good luck for both of us, it actually worked. I really just want my mom. 

9:00: we decide that donuts might make the morning a bit brighter, so my husband orders off the Krispy Kreme app. Turns out, I actually don’t like krispy kreme and start crying again (????) Decide it must be the anti-sad pills changing my tastebuds instead of the donuts themselves. 
My body is incredibly tired from all of the crying, so I take a five hour nap. 

2:00: my favorite café has cheese danishes! I have a free pastry card, so I beg my husband to take me. Just as we pull up, the last Danish is sold. Oh well, they have amazing cookies. I ask them to put a $3 tip on my card. 


5:00: Well I reckon I took another nap. Weekends are not long enough everrrrr. I put on Euphoria on HBO because I read that the soundtrack is totally killer. Spoiler: hell yeah it is. 


11:00: realize my brother hasn’t sent me any pictures of my nieces. I facetime him and say hi to the babies. I miss him so much, this is the longest we’ve ever gone without seeing each other in my life. Mom called us the bookends since he’s 16 months older. I grab my mom’s perfume and hold it close. Time to cry again I guess. 
Daily Spend: $3


April 26th, Sunday:
9:00am: I bounce up and go for a walk (and take my own earbuds, I’ll see that man on investigation discovery if he takes them again before my airpods come in, I swear it on my soullllllll)


10:00: mocha and banana time. Not the best combination I’ve ever come up with, but these bananas are getting eaten before they magically turn into bread. I look at furniture for our sunroom and decide that that’s more important than a love sac since our media room isn’t a focal point in the house. I snuggle the stuffies and my husband, and we take a short nap to kill time. 


3:00pm: So much for a quick nap, wow. I reddit and fiddle on instagram, nothing too exciting. More Euphoria, this show is crazy as hell, they all look like they fell out of 1997 and why don’t any of these kids have a part time job? I praise the powers that be that I graduated high school in 2012 and make sweet potato soufflé. Delicious!


8:30pm: Decide I’ve had enough of the weekend and make my way to bed. My brother sends me a picture of the twins and in the frame is a gorgeous picture of our mom. I try to keep it together, but my husband senses something is up and snuggles me to sleep. I guess he’s probably safe from being on investigation discovery. 


April 27th, Monday:
6:30am: wooooohooo, time to get it done. Work on my cases and trainings for the week until 1pm.


1:00pm: Therapy time. We have a good session, but there’s still a ton of work we need to tackle. When I first started doing therapy, I wasn’t leaving bed or eating or doing basic hygiene because I was hoping I’d just stop existing. I’m back to a functional, albeit hurt version of myself, but I will say this: if you need help, it’s out there. ($25 co-pay)


6:00pm: Two words: Bread sticks. I decide I’m living the OG dream and my husband tags along to pick it up. I only ordered angel hair and bread sticks since my husband wasn’t feeling olive garden, but they threw in free ravioli. He eats it and is quickly thrilled that he got to eat OG after all. ($15 including a $5 tip after a 10% off promo code)

8:00: Talk to my brother, make a new determination that he needs dress socks. Add those to the delusional bitch folder. 
Daily Spend: $40

Home + Health: $296 for therapy and the airpods (I’m including them both here since it’s for my sanity’s sake)
Clothes + Beauty: $0
Transport: $0
Other: $15 for olive garden ayoo


Lastly, reflect on your diary! Definitely not a normal week since I bought the airpods, I justified that with all of the overtime I’ve been working. Usually I spend much more on my hair during this part of the month, but I’m grateful I could skip over it since I wasn’t really in the mood this past weekend. :/ I try to save as much of my income as humanly possible since my brother and I don’t have any sort of parental safety nets anymore, and I’m quite thankful that my husband is on board with that decision.


Edit: [the nieces 💜](https://imgur.com/gallery/0QnYJSr)","For those of you practicing self-quarantine or extreme social distancing, which of your possessions are making the experience more comfortable, especially as you think about doing this for the long haul?

I'll go first:

– My Soda Stream. Never have I been so grateful for my endless stream of carbonation, which is keeping me hydrated and happy.  
– My Kindle, which I use to read library books. Knowing I have an endless supply of reading materials on hand makes it so much easier to stay inside without going nuts.","Just curious about this. The company I work for  is not a corporate environment at all. It's really casual, and pays me really well for my industry, but offers virtually no perks, because they are exceptionally cheap and unprofessional. 

Im talking none. As in- we all use our personal cell phones for work emails and pictures with no reimbursement, there are zero snacks in the office for employees. No fitness classes offered. There is no flex time, leaving early or coming in late needs to be cleared with your manager in advance. 

I guess I'm wondering- when i read these money diaries where people are making $100K+ a year, eating breakfast provided by your company, eating lunch provided by your company, going to a gym class that your company pays for, having your cell phones covered by your company, and then leaving at 5pm on the dot, What exactly do you do? How did you get that job? Did you study something special or have a certain type of previous experience?

Feeling really trapped because I'm really over my job, have had a million interviews and can't seem to land an offer. Ideally I'd love to work at a big company with all of these perks, but whenever i look at their salary ranges for jobs similar to mine, I'm making $20k more than they are offering.","Common spends you don’t identify with (but make up for with your own “niche” spends)? 


There are certain “given” spends that we all have in our diaries, and then there are things some of us spend money on that aren’t necessarily universal but very common. Which of those spends don’t apply to you? 


For example: I don’t drink coffee, so I save money by avoiding daily Starbucks runs, buying Keurig cups, owning a French press, etc. Whenever I see how much money people spend on caffeine I can’t believe it! 
I also don’t drink alcohol so the same feeling applies there - particularly the diaries that include multiple happy hours, trips to the liquor store, mimosas at brunch, etc. 


However, something I spend money on that I don’t often see represented (I can’t think of many ( if any) diaries that mentioned a PURCHASE) is weed. I plan on spending ~$50-100 a month (this comes from my “gig” income and is literally in my budget lol) -  I consider this my version of alcohol and ultimately comparable to what most people probably spend on “going out” or going to the liquor store. 


Another example of a common spend I don’t have is a car. I’m not paying for a car payment, insurance, gas, maintenance, etc - a recent diary that mentioned her bill after going to the mechanic made me anxious!! However, I do pay close to ~$150 a month on public transportation + Ubers, which is comparable for some car owners. While taking public transportation isn’t necessarily “niche” it is a lot less common than owning a vehicle.","I would absolutely make these purchases again (will add links later when I’m on my laptop). Listed from least expensive to most.

- A nice eye mask: so much easier to go to sleep in brightly lit hotel rooms or when my boyfriend is reading in bed.
- A hair turban: this makes getting ready more effortless. I can do my makeup and try on outfits without flinging a sodden towel around. And no more headaches!!
- Doc Martens: versatile and comfortable. I wear them all the time.
- AirPods: I feel so unencumbered.
- iPhone 11: my pictures practically take themselves.
- Nice luggage: packing is less stressful and I can accommodate spontaneous shopping when I travel.
- A comfy couch: self-explanatory. I spend so much time on that thing.

Your turn!","Maybe I’m just being nosy, but I look at some people around me and I’m confused by their lifestyle and income. My neighbors are around my age. They’re married and 29/30 yo. He works at a store and she works a few hours a week at an airport. They go on many vacations every year. I’m talking across the world vacations every month or so. First of all, I would like that much time off work! But also, how do they afford it? I know working for an airline offers free or discounted flights but still! They also drive nice newer cars, eat out frequently, etc. Where my husband and I both make good money and go on zero vacations a year, drive old cars, live in a modest house, and are frugal with our spending every day. 

I guess I just wish it was more socially acceptable to talk about how people afford things because I am so curious. Maybe they figured out some loophole I need to know about!","For me, it has to be either the endless instagram stories of female after female with a glass of wine in their hand EVERY. SINGLE. NIGHT.

**Part Four: Weekly Diary**

**Day 1 - Wednesday**

**9:00AM**\- Wake up and get ready for work. I try to wake up at 8:30AM on most days, but I had a late-night yesterday in Brooklyn attending a Think Olio seminar with some friends about “The Fear of Leisure.” We ended up getting pho afterwards at this amazing place in Greenpoint and spent a while discussing the lecture and what it means to have a balanced lifestyle. I remember to Venmo her for the Uber there (**$12)**, and pick out today’s outfit: Pinky-mauve high-neck chunky wool sweater, tucked into a pair of burgundy windowpane trousers (both from Aritzia), and a pair of platform patent wingtip oxfords from Zara.

**10:10AM**\- Get a reminder email from Amazon that my eBook credit is expiring soon. I bought my Kindle Oasis last year on a whim from an Amazon Bookstore, and it’s my favorite purchase to date. It’s super lightweight, water-resistant, comfortable to hold, and I love taking it to read in cafes and also on flights. I purchase Bad Blood (**$11,** about the rise and fall of Elizabeth Holmes' captivating -scam- company Theranos).

**12:00PM**\- I meet up with a friend for our monthly lunch in our favorite cafe. Usually I have lunch with my team (we have a lot of fun personalities in the team and our lunch topics are always entertaining), but it’s nice to switch it up sometimes. She shares some stories about the guy she’s dating who seems very sweet, which makes me really happy. (Company offers free breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks, and coffee)

**5:15PM**\- J and I leave work and take the train home. We stop by Whole Foods initially to get ingredients for pasta, but it’s too crowded and overwhelming so we head to Morton Williams instead. We pick up rigatoni, vodka sauce, eggplant, onion, french bread, and parmesan ($28 that J covers).

**7:00PM**\- Done cooking dinner! I’ve made an effort to cook at home more this month, and I’ve been really enjoying it so far. I tend to favor Chinese dishes but today we were both craving pasta. We eat while watching an episode of a new anime we recently started (Gintama, recommended by my sister). J got me into anime when we started dating. It’s gotten more mainstream since then, but I never thought I’d love it as much as a I do now in the beginning.

**7:45PM**\- Immediately after dinner, J surprises me with the new Switch Ring Fit Adventure game and sets it up for us to play. We saw an ad for it a few days ago and were really intrigued. According to the game, I “lightly jogged” for about 1 mile, did 36 squats, and 20 knee-to-chests. Would not recommend doing this with a full stomach :D but the adventure part of the game is awesome! Getting around is a lot similar to what I’d think Temple Run would be like in real life, for those who remember how fun and addicting that game was.

**9:00PM**\- I paint my nails with OPI Bubble Bath after showering. Gel manicures are in my past (used to get them every 3-4 weeks), but ever since moving to NYC, the \~$45 after tip just didn’t seem worth it anymore. To all the gals who do their own nails at home-- SECHE VITE IS LIFE-CHANGING!!! I use their base and top coat and my manicure lasts me 2-3 weeks without chipping if I use OPI or Butter London polish.

**10:00PM** \- This is when the shameful me comes out. I am pretty sure I have a shopping addiction. It’s very confusing in the sense that no, I’m not building credit card debt and still “reasonably living within my means,” but I realize the amount of money I spend on fashion is sickening. Growing up, my dad was extremely strict and didn’t allow me to wear makeup or buy clothes I wanted because he thought they would “distract me” from the more important things in life… mainly following the typical Asian-American life-track: excel in school and extracurricular activities, ace the SAT, get accepted to a prestigious college to study a lucrative major -> get a lucrative job. I resented him for taking away my freedom to do \*anything\* (couldn’t hang out with friends, date, go to prom, etc.), but I’ve come to terms with his parenting in a weird the-end-justifies-the-means” way. I am grateful to have this amount of financial privilege. But sometimes I feel like I’m making up for lost time. I’ve always loved makeup and fashion from sneak-watching videos on Youtube in between SAT practice tests. The 2010-ish Youtube era were full of girls who constantly uploaded videos of shopping hauls. I remember thinking how amazing it would be to be able to buy anything I wanted. Once I started working in college, that’s what I did. Now, living in NYC and following amazing Instagram fashion bloggers really eat up my self-control, but also constantly remind me of the years I wanted to feel fashionable and beautiful but couldn’t. This is a super long rant, and I know it does not justify me spending so much money on frivolous things, but… it is a problem for me, and I constantly feel guilty for wasting money I know I should be saving. The guilt and self-hatred is not enough to stop browsing and shopping, so the cycle continues. I purchase an Isabel Marant Etoile sweatshirt ( **$140** on sale, but still not justified), and think about an adorable cozy LoveShackFancy cardigan which is... $495.

**11:00PM**\- Browse some Youtube videos and head to bed.

**Day 2 - Thursday**

**10:20AM**\- Get to work later than I wanted. I haven’t felt motivated for the past week, especially when I’m not working on something coding-heavy (usually how I measure my productivity). I’m also feeling demoralized about work right now, because this week we got back performance reviews, and even though I finished a somewhat impactful project within 4 months of joining the company/team, I didn’t get the feedback that my manager said I would if I did.

**11:10AM**\- My manager brings out this week bread from a bakery on Grand Street, and he says they gave him the wrong bread. It turned out to be the best! Raisins and walnuts yum.

**12:00PM**\- Lunch! Today an engineer visiting another office joins us. I get bok choy, tofu, and eggplant from a cafe.

**4:00PM**\- I get a message from a friend who recently moved to LA. Her boyfriend contacted a bunch of us last week to send in clips wishing her happy birthday, and she just received the video. I’m super happy that she loved it, and that she’s scheduled to come visit for a week next month!

**6:00PM**\- Get off work and take the E train to Saks. I’m meeting up with my friend’s fiance to browse the fall/winter collections. This is my first time hanging out with her-- my friend mentioned that she’s also very into designer things and I always love companions to share my indulgent designer cravings :P To be honest, I’m hoping I won’t find anything that catches my eye because I already splurged on my “yearly treat” to myself on a vintage Cartier watch earlier this year when I got my new job, and I’m just constantly buying clothes too.

**7:00PM**\- We browse around all the boutiques but didn’t find a bag that she loved. Then, we head up to the 8th floor for shoes (my fav) and… WOW I found the most amazing pair of Chanel boots. They’re gold, mid-height heeled combat-ish boots with the classic Chanel black cap-toe design. I made the mistake of trying them on and it took everything for me to not cave and purchase them. $1450 is steep for a pair of boots that I know will get scuffed and ruined so easily… but wow, they’re beautiful and the saleswoman was great at her job haha.

**8:00PM**\- We grab some sushi at a restaurant nearby (**$48**) and chat about bags, her upcoming wedding, relationships, and work. I love getting to know new people, and felt like we got along really well.

**10:00PM**\- My cat comes to cuddle with me on the couch, and I suspect it’s because I’m using his favorite blanket. We adopted him from an ASPCA truck two years ago, and it was the best decision ever. He has such a funny personality and always brightens our day. I start reading Ali Wong’s new book and head to bed after.

    Daily Total: $48

**Day 3 - Friday Hooray!**

**9:00AM**\- I had the weirdest dream yesterday… I think alien (?) attack, and then somehow I got out of a plane mid-air and they tried to rotate the plane to shake me off and I had to keep maneuvering clockwise around the wings to stay on the right side of gravity if that makes sense haha. But wow what an exhausting dream. Today I chose to wear a thick fuzzy black cardigan with gold stars over a white tee, high-rise straight leg denim, a black belt, and Golden Goose hi-stars.

**11:40AM**\- Coffee/latte time. Usually I prefer oat milk, but I only really like Planet Oat’s extra creamy which not a lot of places use. I check my email and yay another item from my recent Thredup box has sold, and now I have a total of $40 credit from this box. I discovered Thredup when they started sponsoring a lot of Youtubers. I found out that they provide shipping labels for free, and it’s essentially the same as selling your clothes to Buffalo Exchange, but way less of a hassle. Granted they pay a lot less for each item, but these days I’m really lazy about listing my pieces on eBay/Poshmark/going into Buffalo Exchange, so sending clothes to sell at Thredup is the superior option over just donating stuff to a local Goodwill.

**1:15PM**\- Late lunch today because I wasn’t hungry. Head to a cafe with a juice bar to get a mix of green juice and ginger shot, and grab a PB&J sandwich to go.

**2:00PM**\- Work offers a lot of cool events, and today I’m signed up for a Japanese tea ceremony and tasting. I head down to attend with a friend, and I eat the best mochi I’ve ever had.

**4:00PM**\- One of my teammates got his promotion!!! We’re all very excited for him and chat a bit about what he’s planning to do for celebration.

**6:15PM**\- Leave work to take the train to Costco with J, my friend and his fiance C (my new friend hehe), who has a Costco membership! I haven’t been to Costco for almost two years so I’m super excited.

**7:10PM**\- We eat dinner at Costco because it’s convenient and also just an insanely good deal. J and I combined get two slices of combo pizza, a chicken bake, a churro, and a diet Pepsi (Costco needs to get out of that partnership and get Coke instead, let’s be real), and the total was only $9.62!! (J pays). We eat in the food court, and talk about how J is the only one who really should be eating 1000+ calories since he runs daily.

**8:30PM**\- Costco closes, and we finish shopping. J and I came mostly for entertainment, but we still managed to buy Alaskan cod, golden kiwi, an umbrella, chicken thighs ($10 for 10 lbs of chicken, crazy deal), salami, and contact solution. We uber back home after ($22, J pays). I venmo my friend who paid for everything with his Costco card (**$76**).

**10:25PM**\- Finish shower and get ready for bed. I browse TJ Maxx (discount/outlet type store for designer brands), my biggest guilty pleasure. Their contemporary line is my favorite because sometimes they carry pieces from my favorite brands like La Maison Tullah, Vince, Theory, and recently Rebecca Taylor! They also regularly have OPI nail polishes for $4. I look through today’s new arrivals and spot this amazing pair of Joe’s lamb leather cropped bootcut pants. I have the Aritzia faux leather Daria leggings, but I’ve been on the hunt for a pair of genuine leather pants, and these are perfect and exactly what I’m looking for. In my cart, I already had this cute polka dot puff-sleeve sweater from Rebecca Taylor, but I move it to “Save-for-later” to make “room” for the pants. I purchase the pants and a faux leather headband with my TJ Maxx credit card which gives 5% cash back (through rewards) for purchases made within the TJX family (**$192**).

    Daily Total: $268

**Day 4 - Saturday**

**9:00AM**\- Wake up and start pack for spa day in New Jersey! I bring my Kindle, journal, and makeup and jewelry to put on later. I choose a DL1961 washed black denim jacket (that @somethingnavy/Arielle Charnas sold me on) to go over a flowy light blue patterned midi dress from last season Zara, and a pair of Golden Goose superstars to wear for the day.

**10:00AM**\- Head out to New Jersey. Last week, I purchased admission tickets to a sauna + spa place in Jersey for J and me. J offered to rent a Zipcar for a whole day so we can drive there, and then to the Queen’s International Night Market which we’ve been meaning to go to this whole summer, and today’s its last day.

**11:00AM**\- Get to the sauna and spa to check in. This business is relatively new, so the design felt very sleek and modern compared to more traditional spas. I signed up for a 30 minute full body scrub ($55, J treats), and wait for my appointment in a Japanese Herbal bath.

**1:30PM**\- I grab a green juice and continue reading Ali Wong’s book in the cozy lounge area. I love feeling warm and zen ($6, J treats).

**4:00PM**\- Leave the spa and browse in a huge supermarket that is right next to the spa. Suburban supermarkets are the best because they have the square footage to carry so much more variety than the ones in the city. We pick up some snacks and a huge bag of rice since we had the Zipcar ($53, J covers).

**4:30PM**\- We head out to pick up our friends who live in Long Island City (and meet their cat!). It’s about an hour and 15 minute drive, but felt manageable as J and I talk about random topics. Traffic wasn’t as bad as we expected on a weekend, so that was a plus :)

**6:30PM**\- Arrive at the Queen’s Night Market! It was a bit chilly at night, but the food was incredible and affordable. We got popcorn chicken, bubble tea, potato crisps, takoyaki, waffle-wrapped mochi, peking duck bao, and lamb skewers (**$43**).

**8:30PM**\- It starts drizzling a little, and the four of us decide to go to Flushing for dessert. We drive and find parking, and I pay for the 2 hours of parking (praise Flushing: **$4**).

**9:30PM**\- I share a green tea crepe cake and a lemongrass ginger carrot herbal tea with J, and our friends share fruit crepe tea and jasmine tea. The boys split the bill (J pays $20).

**11:30PM**\- We return the Zipcar successfully! At home, I wind down and put on an Origins charcoal mask for some skin detox.

    Daily Total: $47

**Day 5 - Sunday**

**10:00AM**\- Wake up to the rain outside. I really love rainy/gloomy days; they have a calming effect on me, and make staying indoors extra cozy. I’m curled up on my couch with a soft blanket, watching the rain, and planning the day. Laundry needs to be done, which reminds me I have to stock up our laundry items. I order Tide Plus Bleach, fabric softener dryer sheets, and another fabric softener for pieces we hang dry from Target. I also throw in probiotic capsules to try them out, and a pack of 6 crew socks as the weather gets colder and I don’t want my ankles to freeze (**$51**).

**10:15AM**\- Make an iced oat milk latte with the Planet Oat extra creamy (as mentioned before hehe it's the best), and a Vietnamese coffee mix. It’s delicious. I do some online browsing and find a gorgeous metallic bronze blazer which would be perfect for upcoming holiday parties, but I resist successfully whew. I also bookmark a Chinti and Parker sweater with a fun rainbow print to consider for later…

**11:05AM**\- I head down the hall to the laundry room on our floor and start two loads. It's $3.60 total, but we have a prepaid card for laundry. J tells me he can take care of the drying cycle and folding since I'm going out later. I guess this is an appropriate time to talk about how amazing J is! We've been dating for a little over three years now, and he's been the most caring, thoughtful, funny and kind boyfriend I've ever had. He's always looking out for ways to make me comfortable and happy (biggest example is when he refills my water bottle at home without me asking... idk what to tell you, I drink a lot of water haha, and also just taking care of a lot of household tasks too-- especially cleaning the litter box!). He makes me feel so loved, and I cherish our relationship so much. I know without a doubt that he's ""my person."" :)

**1:00PM**\- I love wearing bright colors on gloomy days, so I chuck on a chunky yellow high neck mohair sweater from Zara and a pair of Levi’s wedgie icon denim. I meet a friend to check out the newly opened Nordstrom near Columbus Circle. She got a promotion this week, and wanted to treat herself to some nice boots. Before we meet up, I pick out a maple coconut donut from the ultra-cute Nordstrom food court to congratulate her with (**$3**). Shopping was a success! I find her a pair of Acne Jensen dupes (the Marc Fisher Yale booties), and also AGL pointed suede block heel booties. Both look amazing on her, but she decides to only get the lower heel Marc Fisher ones for now, since the AGL ones are higher and tighter on the heel which we agreed would look good with straight leg denim, a style that she doesn’t yet own. We also saw some CDG Converse high-tops that are sold out everywhere, so I had to get them (**$146**)! We head upstairs to look at denim and I also successfully found her a pair of Reformation straight leg denim that look awesome on her, and AGOLDE Riley jeans, my favorite. She loves them both and splurges, and I feel very accomplished as a crazy shopping-enthusiast/enabler :P.

**3:15PM**\- We head out to meet two other friends to see Hustlers! I’ve been wanting to see it for a while, so I’m super excited. J. Lo and Constance Wu?! I still remember when movie tickets were $8… not anymore (**$18**)! We split the largest bucket of popcorn which was delicious (**$3**).

**5:30PM**\- Hustlers was such a fun watch, and we see an advertisement for Parasite as we head down to the lobby, which I recommend everyone to see as well. I love movies, and I probably should sign up for the AMC Stubs A-List… Anyway, we decide to go to Bibble and Sip to hang out for a bit longer, and I get a Matcha Jasmine latte, and an earl grey chocolate chip cookie for everyone to share (**$9**).

**6:00PM**\- I start heading home and call J if he wanted me to pick up anything for dinner. Usually I cook on Sunday nights, but this weekend has been super busy (but full of adventures!). He’s craving McDonalds so I pickup a Quarter Pounder and 20 pieces McNuggets for him (**$16** but who remembers when 20 piece was only $5).

**6:30PM**\- I get home, and J has finished building the new coffee table from Wayfair that I purchased last week! It’s one that can lift up to table-height, and it's already so much more amazing than the one we currently have from West Elm, which is super aesthetic but completely non-functional. I think this new table fits in our space a lot better as well, especially since the color of the wood and metal structured legs match our CB2 bookshelf perfectly. I’ve been really impressed with Wayfair pieces, and also purchased a rug from them before. I eat some nuggets with J as we watch another episode of Gintama.

**8:00PM**\- I watch some Youtube videos and talk with J as he packs a duffle bag for his business trip to California this week.

    Daily Total: $246

**Day 6 - Monday**

**8:15AM**\- Wake up, and finally back on my regular schedule. I peel and slice a huge korean pear that J and I got on Saturday from the supermarket in Jersey for J and myself (it’s delicious). I get ready for work and put on yet another chunky knit, straight leg denim, and glittery bronze Aquazzura pointed-toe mules that make my heart sing. J and I take the train together, as he’s leaving to JFK later from work for his trip.

**9:30AM**\- Grab my usual soy latte and fill up my 30oz Yeti mug with warm water. I try to drink two of those throughout the work day. As I catch up on emails, I found out a team that I did some work for last week thanked me for a “speedy investigation and implementation.” This really makes my day, and motivates me to work hard this week.

**11:00AM**\- Officially the start of my oncall rotation this week. Being “oncall” is essentially getting paged whenever there’s an issue regarding our services that gets escalated through auto-monitoring. Last time I was oncall, I got a page around 1:30AM on a Saturday which I responded to and investigated/addressed the issue. At my previous company, we were expected to be oncall all the time, and weren’t paid for it, so this weekly rotation schedule + compensation for the 24/7 monitoring is pretty good to me.

**11:50AM**\- Lunch with my team. I make a salad with spinach, roasted carrots, sweet potato, and cucumbers. We chat about our weekends and our coworker’s upcoming wedding which we’re all invited to. After lunch, we head down a few floors to grab coffee/juice. I get a green juice (celery, kale, swiss chard, cucumber), with a dash of the “spooky ginger shot” (cranberry juice, ginger, apple cider).

**12:40PM**\- I suddenly remembered that the bundle of dance classes I bought last month were expiring on the 31st and I still had one left, so I book a contemporary class for 7:30PM tomorrow after work. So excited!

**6:40PM**\- Oops still at work. This afternoon I got swamped with so much work, some related to being oncall AKA becoming the “go-to person” for any issue/question, and some from my manager who I had a 1:1 with earlier and thinks I’m ready to take on more responsibilities.

**7:10PM**\- I wrap up, grab some food (salad again) from work, and head home!

**7:40PM**\- Finally get home, feed my cat, take off my makeup, and eat while watching The Mindy Project.

**10:00PM**\- Video chat my grandma. I’m really close to my grandparents because I spent more of my childhood with them than I did with my parents. I feel bad because once I went to college and then started working, I contacted them less and less… I just want to make the most of our time left together.

    Daily Total: $0

**Day 7 - Tuesday**

**8:00AM**\- Wake up and watch the newly uploaded Sheerluxe (UK online fashion/lifestyle magazine that also makes Youtube videos) show. They are discussing event-wear in this episode, which reminds me I still need to pick out outfits for the two holiday work parties J and I have. I fall in love with what Katie Holmes wore to the Nordstrom Party: a black Saint Laurent ruched silk mini dress paired with sheer polka dot tights and black pointed pumps, and decide to order a pair of sheer polka dot tights from Nordstrom (**$40**).

**9:15AM**\- Get to work and feel a little overwhelmed with all the things I need to work on, but I'm feeling extra motivated because I like being productive. I grab my soy latte, fill my Yeti mug with water, and start the day.

**11:35AM**\- My team want to go to lunch earlier today but since I’m not hungry and have a lot to do, I skip out and think I’ll just grab something small later.

**2:00PM**\- I went too late for green juice, so I got a smoothie instead with almond milk, spinach, and a banana. I also make a quick salad to-go.

**5:40PM**\- Early dinner with a friend. We get in line for burrito bowls; I get spinach, chicken, and pico de gallo, and then get back to work.

**7:15PM**\- I should be heading out to make it to my dance class, but I really want to stay and try to figure out a production rollout issue… I decide to stay at work and just forfeit the credit.

**8:00PM**\- Ok, this week has not been a good work-life balance. It’s definitely also because J is away, and he usually reminds me to take breaks, and leave work at a regular hour. There’s just an endless amount of things to do at work, and I like getting things done.

**9:00PM**\- I start The Politician on Netflix! What an interesting show… I watched Dear Evan Hansen with my mom and sister last year, and I love seeing Ben Platt and Laura Dreyfuss playing completely different roles. As I watch, I browse Leandra Medine + Mango collaboration, and consider a sweater. The colors make me really happy, but I know I need to buy a dress for the holiday party soon, so I resist.

**Reflection**

This was overall a normal week for me, with the exception of going out shopping with friends twice! I usually do most of my shopping online, and this week I tagged along with friends who were looking for specific things. The CDG converse were definitely an impulse purchase, but they are so comfortable and cute so... no regrets :P. I am aware I need to reign in my shopping habits, and stop mindlessly online browsing so often, because I know I will always find something I like. I haven't read many diaries that capture buying clothes/shoes on the regular, and feel like I would get ripped to shreds if I posted this on R29 for wasting money so here I am. :D

Also!!! So exciting to see so many women in tech on this sub! I just read the diary of the SWE in seattle, and Ohio diarist going through coding bootcamp :D","Appreciate all you diarists, commenters and the mods ❤️","I know it’s not exactly money-specific, but I feel like it’s relevant since workplace questions have been cropping up here as well. 

I found it pretty recently, and while I don’t always agree with the author’s advice, I feel like she tackles lots of questions I’ve been wondering about but afraid to ask. If people are interested, might be nice to discuss some of the posts here as well—especially since the comments on the site can be as bad as Money Diary comments.","#  Section One: Assets and Debt

**Basic Info:** I’m 30 years old, live in Brooklyn, and make $135k as the Head of Investor Relations. Not too much has changed since my diary in [October](https://www.reddit.com/r/MoneyDiariesACTIVE/comments/dj88qa/im_30_years_old_live_in_brooklyn_and_make/), but I’m in the beginning phases of buying a condo! I’m keeping meticulous track of my experience and purchasing expenses, and I’ll share those once the whole process is over. 

**Retirement Balance (and how you got there):** **$173,871.44** 

This has changed a fair bit since my diary in October. First, I’m in the process of rolling my former company’s 401k into an IRA *then* to my current company’s 401k. (It’s frustrating and complicated). Also, the COVID-19 virus hit the markets, so I've had some losses. Woohoo!

* Betterment Traditional IRA: **$119,293.69** (this was the balance from my former firm’s 401k; \~$100k of this will be moved to my current Firm’s 401k)
* Betterment Roth IRA: **$4,981.25** (This is all of the Roth money from my former company’s 401k; this stays put)
* Current Firm’s 401k: **$5,063.17**
* Current Firm’s 401k Match: **$37,200** as of December 31, 2019. Turns out the “match” my company provides to my 401k is actually money invested in the Firm’s master fund. I’m okay with this for now, but I want more details as to how I access this money. I don’t receive regular statements for this account. 
* Current Firm’s Pension: $22,000 as of December 31, 2019, of which **$7,333.33** is vested. I don’t receive regular statements and we have a 3-year vesting schedule. 

**Equity:** I was so pessimistic in October! I’m in the process of buying a condo *right now*. Soon! 

Here’s the down payment plan, and I’m 100% sure I’ll get some serious criticism for this: 

* Initially, my plan was to take a $50,000 loan against my current company’s 401k + $5k from savings; however, the money movements between accounts have been too slow, as my contract is moving relatively quickly in spite of the scary markets. SO!
* Now, I’m using the majority of my savings below (\~$35k) + an $18k cash advance (0% APR until June 2021) against my Bank of America card. The remaining $2k is a cash advance from my Chase Freedom card (similarly 0% APR for 6 months). 
* Both credit cards will be paid back as soon as I get the loan out from my 401k
   * I decided on the 401k loan for a few reasons: 
      * 1) the majority of this money was in my old firm’s 401k account, which was preventing me from transferring the money into my current company’s 401k - as I was no longer an employee, there were extremely limited options for that pool of money; 
      * 2) the market swings are not my favorite thing and I wanted to diversify my exposure; and,  
      * 3) I’m confident that I’ll continue making money at a steady rate and my current firm’s contribution rate is extremely generous
* I’m setting aside $20k of the $50k for closing costs
* The balance of the $50k (\~$10k) will be used to top off the funds that I withdrew from

Ultimately, the property is just too good to pass up. It’s in the exact same neighborhood, the price is a steal, I could make a 10% down payment and get very favorable mortgage terms. I never thought I’d be able to own property in NYC but I'm on my way! 

**Savings/investment account balance:** 

* Back Up Savings: **$5,100.03** ($100/week automatic deposit)
* Emergency Savings: **$20,002.63** (top up with extra funds when available) - This is turning into the account I’m keeping all of down payment money. 
* Betterment High Yield Savings: **$3,239.06** ($100/bi weekly automatic deposit) - But pending a withdrawal of $2,139.06 for down payment money. 
* Betterment SRI Investment Account: **$1,612.89** ($100/month automatic deposit) - I just made a withdrawal for more down payment money. 

**Checking account balance:** Currently **$2,885.41**, and I still try to maintain a balance above $2k for no reason other than I’m paranoid. Since I only get paid once a month, I deposit my full paycheck into my back up fund and transfer to my checking account as needed.

**Credit card debt:** I (now, lol) pay off my credit cards monthly. I currently have four: Chase Freedom, BofA Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, and Nordstrom. I really only use Chase and BofA regularly. 

**Student loan debt (for what degree):** I have **$39,349.83** left. I just refinanced this from a 7.65% interest rate to a 3.92% interest rate with Earnest and now pay $450/mo. I’m pretty happy with this so far! I don’t have any pre-pay penalties, so I’ll continue to throw all my spare cash at this. 

**Car:** N/A - I never learned to drive and I live in the city. Public transportation is awesome.

# Section Two: Income

**Total Income**: $135k base salary, plus a discretionary annual cash bonus + company pension contribution + 401k “matching.” I don’t know what the payout will look like this year - it really depends on how the rest of the year looks.  

**Main Job Take Home Pay:** **\~$6200** 1x/mo

**Additional income/side hustle:** I had a pretty serious depressive episode over the winter, so I’m just now getting back into ceramics again. I’ve also closed my Patreon until I build up stock. 

# Section Three: Expenses

**Pre-tax Deductions**:

* Health Insurance: $160 (I opted for the “better” plan because of some scary health issues last year)
* Vision Insurance: $8.45
* 401(k): $758
* Healthcare FSA: $13
* Transit Card: $128 (this is my favorite thing; it covers a monthly unlimited metrocard!)

**Home**: \~$1,700 per month (This is going to change pretty dramatically once I move into my new condo!)

* **Rent**: \~$1,000; I share a 2br/2 bath apartment in Brooklyn with my friend B and his girlfriend A (they have the master) and the total rent is $3350, which includes gas and water.
* **Renter’s Insurance**: $200 annually. I pay in a lump sum at the beginning of the year.
* **Electric**: Varies; usually between $200-300, depending on the month. This month was $225. I take care of this bill, B takes care of the internet bill.
* **Groceries**: Varies; I feed only myself (A and B are vegetarian), so I spend maybe $200-300/mo on groceries? I spent $262 in February. 
* **Pet food**: $45 once a month for wet food with an additional $55 every other month for dry + a pallet of additional smaller cans (why do cans come in pallets of 24??). B takes care of cat litter.

**Subscriptions & Memberships**: \~$290 per month

* **Amazon Prime**: $119 per year; I pay annually
* **Netflix**: $12.99 (my streaming accounts are all linked to the PS4 in the living room, so I share with my roommates but don’t ask them to contribute anything. It all works out)

**Day 1 - Monday March 16, 2020**

6:15AM - Good morning! Just kidding, why am I awake? I woke up around 3AM again, too. I roll over and try to go back to sleep. 

7:15AM - I give up, dig my Kindle out from under my pillow and read Chuck Wendig’s *The Wanderers* until my actual alarm. 

8:20AM - My alarm goes off. This is my third day of working from home thanks to COVID-19. I take my meds and put my contacts in for the 8:30AM (virtual!) team meeting. 

My firm spent a lot of time developing and testing a remote desktop, and they’ve added in video capabilities. Unfortunately, this means I have to have my webcam on all day (!), to be seen on the “virtual trading floor.” Super invasive!

9:02AM - Morning meeting finally over. I order a sausage egg and cheese bagel sandwich, dry bagels, and some scallion cream cheese for breakfast today and the rest of the week (**$25.64**, including $5 delivery tip). I’m still trying to get into a routine for working from home and breakfast is, I’m learning, essential. I’ll make my own coffee though. I ran out of turbinado so I’m using agave syrup and I don’t hate it?

9:34AM - Bagel sandwich time mmmmmmmm

9:36AM - Bagel sandwich is missing cheese :(

10:28AM - Finished a draft of our monthly commentary and shoot it off to our trader, who usually drafts these things. We had our quarterly client call last week, so I cobbled together something from my notes. I hope that I didn’t get anything too inaccurate! I have zero background in finance, so I feel like a big ol’ faker when I talk markets. 

10:30AM - My loan officer calls! I got a letter at the end of last week saying that the bank didn’t have any loan options for me - YIKES! My loan officer cleared that up (a mistake on his end), and let me know he was going to provide new rates given that the Fed dropped rates again (we’re essentially at zero, people!). I’m curious to see what he comes back with and proceed to refresh my email incessantly. 

11:13AM - Love watching my coworkers eat on the spy cam. 

11:44AM - After a flurry of emails this morning, work has slowed down. I think I’m going to nap on my lunch break. 

11:58AM - C ([loud baby cat](https://imgur.com/CUOeC4O)) rouses from her nap on the sofa to make an appearance on the virtual trading floor (she stands in front of my webcam). I move her to my lap so I can actually see my screen. Nobody seems to have noticed I temporarily turned into a cat. 

12:20PM - Turn off my spy cam to lie down for a nap. The morning bagel sandwich hasn’t sat well with me. C comes to join me, but since she doesn’t normally sleep in bed with me, she doesn’t know where to settle. First, she gets under the covers and spoons my butt with her cold, wet nose pressed against my lower back. Eventually, she makes it up to my chest as a little spoon, under one of my arms. So cute!!

1:30PM - Wake up and back to work.

2:19PM - BORED. I try to do some pecking at my novel project that I’m preparing for Camp NaNoWriMo. Every time I do this, I lose confidence in my story… 

2:30PM - Still feeling queasy, so I have a small bowl of cereal in an attempt to soothe my stomach. The latest switch up in my antidepressant regime has resulted in poor sleep and lots of nausea. On the other hand, I feel LOADS better mentally. I’m hoping the nausea will get better with time… 

3:00PM - I buy a **$40** unlimited monthly pass for digital classes at my yoga studio. I’ve been meaning to pick this up again, so I’ll start virtually! I book a Tuesday class. 

4:16PM - The real trap of social distancing is that I’m more and more tempted to shop online. I close some open tabs. 

6:28PM - Of course the last hour of my day gets stupidly busy. I finally get to sign off the spy cam! 

7:00PM - I make a farro bowl for dinner. It includes: sauteed kale, half an avocado, and a softish boiled egg (I left it in too long…). I top it with this really awesome tahini dressing I whipped up based on a [NYT recipe](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019878-farro-broccoli-bowl-with-lemony-tahini). I am suddenly RAVENOUS and I scarf it down while watching the second half of *Westworld* season 2, episode 1. I know, I’m late. But I was depressed, ok?

7:30PM - My loan officer sends me a homebuyer course to get $500 of credits from the bank. Sure! I zip through it (I already know basically all of these things), and email my loan officer the certificate of completion a little before 8PM. 

8:00PM - I play a couple of rounds of *Overwatch.* 

8:55PM - I make my usual cup of sleepy tea and watch another episode of *Westworld*. 

10:30PM - Bed time. I put on a soundscape from Headspace and drift off to sleep. 

**Day 1 Spend**: $65.64

**DAY 2 - Tuesday March 17, 2020**

2:00AM - Why?

4:30AM - Please.

8:20AM - Last alarm goes off. I roll out of bed for the morning team meeting. My butt feels bruised from sitting all day yesterday. 

10:46AM - Off of my morning client call. I make some coffee and toast a bagel from yesterday. I realize they sent me plain bagels :( At least I have scallion cream cheese. C joins me for breakfast, trying very hard to be as on top of me as possible. 

12:00PM - Weirdly busy morning. Lots of client calls and requests - everyone’s freaked out about the market! I take some time to check the money movements I have in process. It looks like my 401k transfer from my old firm’s platform has made it over to Betterment. Neat! Now I have to figure out how to get the Traditional IRA from Betterment over to my new firm’s 401k.

12:30PM - I decide to do a 30 minute low impact ride with Peloton digital. I like the low impact rides - my lungs can barely handle cardio, but I’m working on it. However, 10 minutes into my ride, the building’s super comes in to let me know they’re going to clean the gym in 10-15 minutes. I eke out another 10 minutes before I’m kicked out. Also, I realized my butt is just saddle sore from Sunday’s ride lmao. 

On my way back up to my apartment, I grab my new monitors from the package room. My company offered reimbursements for certain home office equipment, and I’ve been meaning to upgrade my set up. 

1:43PM - After a quick body shower, half a liter of water, and an apple, I’m back at my desk with my spy cam on. 

3:33PM - Get off yet another client call and pour myself a bowl of cereal. There’s rumors of a full shut down of NYC in 48 hours, so I’m making a last minute grocery list to round out my fridge/pantry. I really didn’t want to spend money today!

4:40PM - Finished typing and circulating my notes. It looks like it might be a shelter-in-place thing and not a full shut down thing. I’ll hold off on panic buying; I have enough food at home. 

5:10PM - Oh, my yoga got cancelled :( 

6:05PM - Finally log off!

6:30PM - Since yoga was cancelled, I’m making a really healthy dinner of pan seared brussels, spinach tortellini in my quickie alfredo sauce (basically a splash of cream and a lot of cheese), and a very large glass of red wine. I eat while watching *Below Deck: Sailing Yacht*. 

7:45PM - I hop onto *Overwatch* for a couple of rounds. I bring a pint of Half Baked with me too. 

8:30PM - After six PotGs in a row, I feel like I should let other people play the game. I put away the ice cream (I ate maybe a third?), and make a cup of sleepy tea. I turn on *Before the 90 Days*. On one hand, these people make me feel better about my life. On the other hand, I’m jealous that they’ve (sometimes) found people who love them?? How do romance?

9:43PM - Omg!!! I finally grew a 5-star plant in [Plant Daddy](https://overfull.itch.io/plantdaddy)!!! I love him!!! 

10:30PM - Brush teeth, night time routine, in bed and reading *The Wanderers*. 

**Day 2 Spend**: $0!

**Day 3 - Wednesday March 18, 2020**

6:00AM - Nope. Although, this is better than usual. 

7:00AM - Still nope. 

8:00AM - I give up. Lie and bed and scroll Instagram for a bit. I manage to get up and make coffee before the 8:30AM meeting! 

9:45AM - After the morning meeting and formatting our monthly report (including nudging those who have ignored my commentary draft), I get up to toast a bagel. C and D are sleeping on the job (aka napping in the morning sunlight). 

10:57AM - Come up for air again. Looks like the last bits of down payment monies have hit my account. Not that my contract is anywhere in sight, but I can breathe easy. 

11:43AM - I spent half an hour reorganizing my bookmarks. 

12:26PM - My 12:00 call got pushed to 3PM so I spend some time getting paperwork together for my IRA transfer. I want to overnight these docs, but I don’t know if the post office or UPS is open at the moment… I want a nap.

12:31PM - Okay, yeah, lunch break nap. 

1:45PM - I’m awake. I think I sort of slept? I wander into the kitchen to find something to eat but nothing sounds appetizing. My new antidepressants are really messing with my appetite. I settle on a lemon flavored Noosa yogurt, which I eat half of. 

2:26PM - I make a cup of green tea. The last part of my day is back to back calls. I am not ready. 

3:26PM - Got through my first call but oh man, I am super nauseous from the green tea. I need to lie down. But more calls await. 

5:53PM - Nearly threw up during my last call… One more call and then I can lie down again. Ugh! 

6:17PM - My 6PM call is running late. Please let me sign off work. 

6:50PM - I get off my call and log off work finally. I go to the kitchen for something to eat, but instead I end up having a very tough conversation with my roommate B. He’s really hurt by my decision to buy a condo and we talk about it. He leaves with A for a walk and I go cry in my room. 

8:00PM - I eat dinner at some point (farro, soft boiled egg, half an avocado, and that tahini sauce again). My best friend E convinces me to play some *Overwatch*. It’s our favorite event, with our favorite game mode, so I agree, even though I’m still feeling pretty shitty. 

9:00PM - Stop playing *Overwatch*. Go back to crying. 

10:00PM - Well, I lost an hour. Guess it’s time for bed. 

**Day 3 Spend**: $0!

**Day 4 - Thursday, March 19, 2020**

4:25AM - Why.

8:26AM - Drag myself out of bed for the morning meeting. 

9:17AM - I get a note from Amazon that my copy of *Animal Crossing: New Horizons* is going to be delayed. I cancel the physical copy and buy the digital copy (**$64.54**, though the original one will be reimbursed). I make a cup of coffee and a bagel and sit down in front of my computer. C follows me around while I putz in the kitchen. 

9:30AM - I throw **$20** to the *Plant Daddy* developer. 

10:30AM - Virtual therapy appointment time. This will be $250 (noted in the Health section in my expenses above). 

11:15AM - Therapy over. I wash my face before getting back on the spy cam. We talked about my conversation with my roommate last night, and I feel a bit better. Back to work. 

11:45AM - Go down to the package room to grab my Girl Scout cookies (1 box of Thin Mints, 2 boxes of shortbread, 1 box of Lemonades and 1 box of S’mores). More work, even though my day is much less busy than yesterday. 

12:30PM - I’m going to venture out, mostly for sanity reasons, but also because I need groceries. I drop off packages at the post office, which include two donation boxes to thredUP, two mugs I threw for my uncle, and some papers to get my IRA transferred (**$34.95**). Everyone is standing 6ft apart and I appreciate that. Next, I head to the corner grocery store. It’s pretty ravaged. I pick up a variety of fresh vegetables, eggs, cereal, Cheez-its (an essential), chicken cutlets, and two different kinds of cider (**$84.32**). Oof. 

1:48PM - Back at home, back on my spy cam.

3:30PM - Realized I haven’t eaten lunch so I wander into the kitchen to find something to eat. I end up with a bowl of cereal, which I now realize is actually granola. I chat with A for a bit, which is nice. Then I’m back in front of my spy cam with a bowl of Cheez-its. 

6:00PM - The rest of the day was just working - people finally started paying attention to my requests to review the reporting I’ve been working on all week. I sign off a quarter after six, annoyed. 

6:30PM - I feed the cats and start making dinner. I bread two of the chicken cutlets in a mix of panko and romano before I pan fry them. I scoop some of the farro into a bowl and dress it with the tahini sauce. I take both back to my room with a rose cider I bought earlier. I take a bite of chicken and can tell immediately I undercooked it. I have such a Thing with chicken - I don’t know why I even bothered trying to cook it. I take it back into the kitchen to cook it through, but I’m pretty squicked out. The farro is also really bad plain like this. I watch *90 Day Fiance: Before the 90 Days* while I eat. 

7:20PM - After I eat, I start assembling the ingredients for [Hokkaido milk bread](https://food52.com/recipes/30962-hokkaido-milk-bread). I think I ruin the tangzhong! My dough is definitely too dry. I add a little more milk and cream and hope for the best. Stash the dough in the fridge for a slow overnight rise. 

8:00PM - I grab another rose cider and hop onto *Overwatch* for a few rounds. I get an amazing PotG as Ana and I’m pleased as punch. 

9:00PM - Go down to the package room to pick up an order from Ann Taylor - a bunch of work shirts. I love them all (polka dots, leopard print, poppies, and a striped shirt) and immediately hang them in my closet. Maybe I’ll wear one tomorrow to feel more like I’m actually Working?

9:15PM - Shit! I forgot about yoga at 7!! 

9:45PM - I eat two Lemonades out of my Girl Scout delivery. Make a cup of sleepy tea and finish watching the *College Behind Bars* documentary series on Netflix. 

10:30PM - Ugh, it’s late. I dawdle through my nighttime routine even though I’m bone tired. I should’ve washed my hair earlier. The fact that I have to work tomorrow feels cruel. 

**Day 4 Spend**: $203.81 (yikes)

**Day 5 - Friday, March 20, 2020**

1:25AM - Hm. 

8:00AM - This is better! I actually slept okay last night. I wake up in the middle of a dream that somehow combines my ceramic studio, one of my clients, and historical cosplay (?). I doze until my 8:20AM alarm and then get up for the morning meeting. 

10:45AM - Um. I might have been playing the new *Animal Crossing* all morning. I did do some actual work before I started playing, though, honest! I’m hungry so I get up to make some coffee and pour a bowl of granola. I check on the dough in the fridge and it’s not looking great. At least I got paid today!

12:30PM - I lie down for a nap, but I forgot to mute the “trade floor,” so my boss's dulcet tones wake me up about 20 minutes later. I give up, scroll instagram for a bit, then decide to get up and make lunch. I have a pie shell in the freezer so I decide to make a quiche! It’s so simple: four eggs, one cup of milk/cream/half and half, your choice of cheese, then whatever veg you want to throw into it. I make a broccoli, prosciutto and cheese (romano/parm/mild cheddar/gruyere) quiche. While it’s cooking, I check on my dough again. I think I have to trash it. 

2:00PM - I have a call with my attorney for the condo. Still no closing date; in fact, because of the total shut down of NYC, construction is probably halted for the time being. My lawyer thinks we might close at the end of summer, but warned that it could go longer, depending on how long the COVID-19 impact lasts. I’m actually okay with this since it’ll give me time to save up more and pay down more. 

2:30PM - Back in front of my desk, playing *Animal Crossing* and answering emails as they come up. 

3:00PM - Another client call. 

7:40PM - The rest of the afternoon (and much of the evening!) was waiting for people to provide commentary on the markets for the week and reporting for one of our big clients. I got the commentary out a little after 6:30PM but I wait nearly another hour for the reports for this client. I get up and make dinner while I’m waiting - I make fried rice but with farro instead. It’s really good! I trash the bread dough :( I also crack open a rose cider. I need it. 

11:30PM - ...I spent the rest of the night playing *Animal Crossing*. Good night! 

**Day 5 Spend:** $0!

**Day 6 - Saturday March 21, 2020**

2:00AM - Okay, cool. 

6:00AM - No. 

8:30AM - I’ve been tossing and turning for two hours. I get up to get my Switch and turn on *Animal Crossing*. 

12:30PM - I am limited by my console’s battery. I make some coffee and head back into my room. 

1:00PM - Thinking of taking up knitting? I end up placing an order from We Are Knitters for a beginner kit (**$63**). Maybe it’ll get here before the quarantine is over… I also buy myself a gift card for my ceramics studio, which has been forced to close (**$108.15**). I want them to stay in business!!

2:30PM - I’ve been playing *Animal Crossing*, but pause to make some noodles with that cheesy sauce again. I let my Switch charge while I eat. 

4:30PM - I’m sleepy. I lie down for a nap, but my abuela calls. I have to answer because I’ve… been avoiding talking to her. Fortunately I can distract her with the news about my condo purchase endeavor. 

6:10PM - My mom calls me. I don’t think I mentioned that my parents flew across the country in the middle of the week to see my sister? Yeah, worst idea ever. *Now* my mom is concerned about COVID-19 and is planning on flying back to California early, just in time for a full shelter-in-place order. I assure her I’m fine and don’t know anybody who’s gotten the virus. She sounds stressed, but I think that has more to do with dealing with my dad and my sister than anything. I tell her to travel safe and call if she needs anything. 

6:20PM - While eating Cheez-its, I realize I should probably eat real dinner. I place an order with my favorite neighborhood Thai place (**$23.14**), because not only do I want them to stay in business, but apparently I need to spend *more* money today. 

6:40 - Thai food is here! I eat the spring rolls with a cider, but I sort of ruined my appetite with the Cheez-its. Whoops. At least I’ll have leftovers! 

7:11PM - My dad calls. I guess I’ll talk to every family member today! He tells me about how he finally got his insulin - but had to go to Mexico to get it. I think he’s said before that a week’s supply of one of the types of insulin he takes was something like $450, or $3000 for a three month supply - and, yeah, he has insurance. He managed to get a month of all his medications for $350 in Tijuana. Oy!! We also gush about *Animal Crossing*. My dad’s delighted. He wants to visit my island when he’s back in California. I tell him to travel safe and to not touch anything. 

10:54PM - Uhh, yeah, I’ve been playing more *Animal Crossing*. I paid off my home loan! Love a game where I can accomplish what I can’t in real life. I remember that I’m out of coffee. I place an order from Blue Bottle (**$39**) in hopes that this will get to me early next week. I put away my Switch and make some sleepy tea. 

**Day 6 Spend:** $233.29

**Day 7 - March 22, 2020**

4:00AM - Please!

5:00AM - No!!

9:30AM - 30 more minutes… 

1:03PM - Um. Oops. Time to get out of bed?

5:02PM - I basically played *Animal Crossing* all afternoon. Seriously, this game couldn’t have come at a better time. But I should also, like, *do* something. I go downstairs for a 30 minute ride with Peloton. I’m seriously contemplating a Peloton bike when I move into my own place, but we’ll see about that. 

5:45PM - After a body shower, I change my sheets and… go back to playing *Animal Crossing*. I’m so sorry. That’s what I do for the rest of the night too. 

**Day 7 Spend:** $0!

**Weekly Total: $502.74**

**Reflection**

Um, oof?? Despite a few zero spend days, I managed to spend more than I usually do in a week. To be fair, usually I wouldn’t be buying a gift card to my ceramics studio or spend this much on video games (I’m normally slow to adopt a new game), but I think I definitely over spent on food this week. What I have in the fridge should last me through the next week as well, so hopefully I’ll spend less in the coming days. (update: I've so far only spent $20 since Sunday! Go me!)

Honestly, I thought I’d have some more condo expenses this week, but COVID-19 really slowed the process down (understandably!). Since my close date has been pushed out to the end of summer, I’ve got more time to save my pennies and pay myself back from all my money manipulations. 

The hardest thing about this week was not really having the option to go out and about. I kind of miss my commute?! My venture to the post office and grocery story felt illegal. I’m definitely feeling increasingly restless/anxious/isolated, so any tips you might have to cope would be appreciated! Stay safe and healthy out there!","The government wants to close down everything. They may mandate the temporary suspension of mortgages and rents. Student loan payments.
